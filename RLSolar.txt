Roof Leasing and Shared Solar Opportunities in TX, NM, and CO

Introduction

Roof leasing and shared solar deployment models are emerging as innovative ways to expand solar energy access. In this model, a solar developer leases commercial rooftop space from property owners, installs a solar array, and sells the electricity either to building occupants, the grid, or subscribers in a community solar program. This approach can unlock vast underutilized roof space on warehouses, malls, and flat-topped commercial buildings, providing property owners with passive income and communities with more clean power. This report investigates the viability of such models in Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado – three states with diverse regulatory landscapes – and provides strategic insights for a mid-sized solar installer considering entry into this space.

We examine: (1) how novel the roof-lease/shared solar model is in each state and real-world examples to date; (2) major players (national and regional) offering these services; (3) current market size, share, and growth rates in TX, NM, and CO; (4) policy frameworks governing these opportunities – including net metering, virtual net metering, ERCOT grid access in Texas, utility rules, and incentives (tax credits, USDA grants, etc.); (5) logistical, legal, and financial barriers; and (6) the feasibility and strategies for a mid-sized installer to enter this space. We also highlight key legislative or regulatory changes expected in 2025–2026, recommended go-to-market approaches, and profiles of top competitors or notable projects. The goal is to provide a comprehensive, state-specific analysis with actionable insights for strategic planning.

Business Model Overview: Roof Leasing & Shared Solar

Roof Leasing Model: A solar developer (or third-party investor) leases a rooftop (or parking lot) from a property owner, typically at little or no cost to the owner, in exchange for the right to install and operate solar panels. The developer owns and maintains the system. The power generated can be handled in several ways: sold to the building’s tenants or owner via a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), sold back to the grid (either at wholesale or via a net metering arrangement), or allocated to multiple off-takers through a shared solar program. The property owner benefits by receiving lease payments or electricity credits, turning unused roof space into revenue  . The developer earns revenue from electricity sales and retains renewable energy credits or incentives.

Shared Solar / Community Solar: Shared solar (often synonymous with community solar) refers to a larger solar array whose output is shared among multiple subscribers who receive credits on their electric bills for their portion of the generation . This model enables people who cannot install panels on their own roof (e.g. renters, condo-dwellers, businesses lacking suitable roof space) to still “go solar” by subscribing to a share of a local solar farm. In many states, community solar programs allow a third-party developer to build a solar project (which could be ground-mounted or on a large roof) and sell subscriptions to households or businesses. The utility then applies virtual net metering credits or similar bill credits to the subscribers’ bills for their share of the energy produced . The developer earns revenue by selling the energy to the utility or into the grid and passing on a discount to subscribers (for example, subscribers might save around 10% on their bills on average ).

Combining the Models: Roof leasing can be the physical arrangement, and shared solar can be the business arrangement for the energy. For instance, a developer might lease a mall’s flat roof to host a 1 MW solar array, then enroll dozens of nearby households or small businesses to buy the output through a community solar subscription. Alternatively, the power might be sold directly to the building’s tenants (if regulations allow) or to the local utility under a feed-in tariff or net metering program. The key elements are: a third-party owned solar system, a host site (roof) separate from many of the end-users, and a mechanism to distribute benefits of the energy to one or multiple off-takers.

This model has several potential advantages: it taps into idle roof real estate in urban areas, avoids land-use conflicts, brings rental and multi-tenant customers into the solar market, and can provide predictable lease income to property owners. However, it also faces unique challenges, including complex metering arrangements, regulatory hurdles for selling power to third parties, and the need to manage multi-party contracts (with property owners, subscribers, utilities, etc.). We will now explore how this model is playing out (or not) in our focus states.

Market Adoption and Examples by State

Texas: Nascent Efforts in Utility Programs

In Texas, the roof-leasing shared solar model is still fairly novel, but a few pioneering programs have emerged. Texas does not have a statewide community solar policy, and its deregulated electricity market and patchwork net metering rules have historically limited shared solar growth. Until recently, most solar in Texas was either utility-scale farms or customer-owned rooftop installations. Third-party owned rooftop systems selling power to tenants or the grid have been rare outside of specific programs.

Real-World Examples: The two most notable examples come from Texas’s municipal utilities: Austin Energy and CPS Energy (San Antonio).
	•	Austin Energy’s Solar Host Program (2024): In late 2024, Austin Energy launched a Solar Standard Offer initiative to dramatically expand rooftop solar capacity by leveraging private capital. This program allows commercial property owners to either install their own solar panels or lease their roof space to third-party solar developers, with Austin Energy buying the energy output . The solar power feeds into Austin’s grid and contributes to the utility’s Community Solar Program for city residents, including low-income customers . For property owners who lease out their roof or parking lot, there are no upfront costs – they simply receive a rental income (or bill credit) while the developer sells energy to the utility . This is a game-changer for Texas: essentially a feed-in tariff model where Austin Energy acts as the off-taker for rooftop solar hosted on commercial buildings. The program’s goal is to add significant distributed solar capacity by tapping expansive flat roofs in the city’s territory. (Austin Energy has been a leader in renewables; this program builds on their existing Community Solar farm offerings and could serve as a template for other Texas cities.)
	•	CPS Energy’s SolarHost Pilot (2015–2017): CPS Energy, the municipal utility in San Antonio, ran one of the first “rent-a-roof” solar programs in the nation. Under the SolarHostSA pilot, CPS partnered with a local developer (PowerFin Partners) to install 10 MW of solar panels on the rooftops of homes and businesses at no cost to the host customers . Participants essentially leased their roof to the utility’s developer and in return received a small bill credit each month for the power produced . The solar energy was fed into CPS’s grid, and CPS paid the developer via a PPA. This program specifically targeted traditionally underserved areas and removed cost barriers for those customers . SolarHostSA proved very popular – it was fully subscribed quickly with hundreds of roofs outfitted – demonstrating community interest in such a model . While limited in scale, it showed that even in Texas’s unique market, a utility-facilitated roof-leasing model could work. CPS has since extended or complemented this with “Roofless Solar” community solar farms for subscribers , but SolarHost remains a notable early example of shared solar via roof leasing in Texas.

Outside of Austin and San Antonio, shared solar is not widely implemented in Texas yet. Deregulated retail providers in ERCOT have offered buyback plans for customer-owned rooftop solar (crediting excess generation), but formal community solar programs or third-party roof leasing arrangements are scarce. A few rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities have launched community solar gardens (typically small ground-mounted arrays where co-op members can purchase shares), but these are usually utility-operated and on utility property. For example, Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative and Pedernales EC each built community solar farms for their members, though these did not involve leasing private roofs. In the competitive retail areas (Oncor, CenterPoint service areas), no standard mechanism exists for virtual net metering or community solar, which has stunted development of multi-party solar projects.

That said, interest in the concept is growing as shown by Austin’s and CPS’s initiatives. There have also been private inquiries – for instance, property owners in Houston have explored leasing rooftops to solar developers via PPAs or private deals (the concept occasionally surfaces on forums and Reddit, indicating nascent interest ). The novelty remains high: Texas has thousands of acres of commercial roof space (e.g. big-box stores, warehouses owned by REITs) that are currently unused for energy. With supportive policy, this could be a major growth area. But for now, Texas’s real-world examples are limited to those utility-led programs. The model is beginning to take hold, but it is not yet common practice statewide.

New Mexico: A New Community Solar Market on the Rise

New Mexico is in the early stages of implementing a community solar program that opens the door for roof-leasing models. This is a very new development – the enabling legislation (Senate Bill 84) passed in 2021, and the first wave of projects was just selected in 2023  . In other words, the model is still novel in NM, but it’s on the cusp of real growth with significant interest from developers.

Real-World Examples: As of early 2025, no community solar installations are operational yet in New Mexico (none were online in 2024) . However, the Public Regulation Commission (PRC) has approved 45 projects totaling 200 MW_ac in a first round of solicitations . These projects, spread across the state’s three investor-owned utility territories (PNM, SPS/Xcel, and El Paso Electric), will form the backbone of New Mexico’s community solar pilot program. The response to the solicitation was enormous – the PRC received over 400 proposals totaling ~1.7 GW for the initial 200 MW cap  – indicating extremely high developer interest. The selected 45 projects are now in development, with the first expected online by late 2025 or 2026 . One of the first to break ground (in mid-2024) is a community solar array on New Mexico State Land Office property , showing the state’s support by providing public land for projects.

Most of these initial projects are likely to be ground-mounted in rural areas (for ease of interconnection and scale). However, the program rules do not preclude rooftop community solar, and as the market matures we could see commercial roofs in cities like Albuquerque, Santa Fe, or Las Cruces being leased for community solar installations. In fact, policy advocates have pointed out the potential of business rooftops to increase solar access in urban New Mexico as the program grows . For example, a large warehouse in Albuquerque could host a 2–5 MW solar array, and residents could subscribe to it under the program. As of now, we have not yet seen specific publicized deals of this nature (since the program is brand new), but the concept is viable under NM’s framework.

One local example of a shared solar approach (outside the new program) has been PNM’s Solar Direct and other utility renewable energy offerings, where entities like cities or tribes could subscribe to a share of a solar farm. But those are utility-scale and not rooftop-based. The real action in NM will be through the formal community solar program.

Given the strong developer response, it’s clear the model is not entirely novel to the industry – many experienced community solar companies have swooped in to stake a claim in New Mexico. What is novel is the context: New Mexico’s abundant sun and the program’s requirement that 30% of each project’s capacity benefit low-income subscribers  make it an attractive proving ground for innovative business models. We expect to see a variety of approaches, potentially including partnerships with city governments or affordable housing providers to use their rooftops for shared solar serving renters.

In summary, New Mexico’s roof-leasing/shared solar model is in its pilot phase. Real-world examples are just now being constructed, so 2025–2026 will be a critical period to watch. The model itself (leasing roofs to host community solar) is not brand new in a national sense, but its application in New Mexico is just beginning. If the first projects (mostly ground-mounted) succeed, we anticipate the concept extending to rooftops, especially as urban opportunities are explored in later phases of the program.

Colorado: A Pioneering State with a Decade of Community Solar Experience

Colorado was the trailblazer for community solar in the United States – the concept of a “solar garden” was practically invented here with the Community Solar Gardens Act of 2010 . Over the past decade, Colorado has built a substantial community solar market, including some installations on commercial and public rooftops. Thus, the shared solar model is not novel in Colorado; it’s a well-established part of the solar industry. However, using leased commercial roofs as the host sites for community solar is just one of several deployment models (many projects have been ground-mounted on open land).

Real-World Examples: As of 2023, Colorado was home to 177 community solar projects totaling about 272 MW_DC – enough to power roughly 52,000 homes . These are spread across the state, with the largest share in Xcel Energy’s territory (the Front Range urban corridor). Most of these projects are in the 0.5 to 5 MW size range. While detailed breakdowns of rooftop vs. ground-mount aren’t readily available, we do know that several community solar arrays have been built on rooftops or parking structures in Colorado:
	•	For instance, the City of Denver has undertaken an initiative to install 15+ community solar gardens on municipal properties, including rooftops of city buildings, parking lot canopies, and vacant land . These projects serve city facilities and low-income households, demonstrating the feasibility of rooftop shared solar in an urban setting.
	•	SunShare, a Colorado-based developer, built many of its early community solar gardens on land, but it has also explored rooftop sites when available. (SunShare’s portfolio of over 90 solar gardens – ~144 MW – serves thousands of subscribers and includes a mix of site types) .
	•	In Boulder, a notable project involves the University of Colorado leveraging a virtual net metering arrangement to buy power from an off-site 5 MW solar array (developed by Pivot Energy) for campus use  . While that particular project is ground-mounted, it was enabled by Colorado legislation in 2021 allowing off-site solar subscriptions for large customers – a variation on the shared solar theme that could also be applied to rooftop projects (e.g. CU could have just as well partnered on a warehouse roof project).
	•	Some smaller towns and co-ops have put solar panels on school rooftops or community center roofs and virtually shared the output with residents. These tend to be one-off demonstration projects but show that technically and legally, rooftop community solar is workable in Colorado under the right circumstances.

Overall, Colorado’s community solar experience is extensive: it was the first state to mandate that utilities offer the community solar model, and it has steadily grown since 2010  . However, growth was somewhat slow and steady – reaching just under 200 MW by 2024  – until a recent policy boost (discussed later) that promises to accelerate it. In terms of novelty, the idea of shared solar is well entrenched. Many Coloradans are familiar with subscribing to solar gardens, and numerous developers and financiers are active in this market.

Using leased roofs specifically is still a subset of the market. Many early projects opted for cheaper ground sites (like farms or brownfields) due to ease of permitting and construction. But as open land near load centers becomes scarcer or more expensive, developers have started eyeing big flat roofs. Companies like Pivot Energy and others have explicitly advertised to commercial real estate owners about hosting solar. Nationally, REITs like Prologis (which owns millions of square feet of warehouse roofing in Colorado) have begun partnering with solar firms to utilize that space for community solar where policy allows  . We can anticipate Colorado seeing more such partnerships, especially because new state rules increase the allowable size of community solar projects on “preferred” sites (which likely include rooftops) up to 10 MW_AC   – a significant scale that makes commercial roofs more attractive economically.

In summary, Colorado is the most mature market of the three states for shared solar. The model isn’t novel there – it’s a proven concept, supported by a decade of customer participation. There are real-world examples of both ground-mounted and rooftop shared solar projects, with a trend towards more innovative siting (including roofs) as the program expands. Colorado’s experience provides valuable lessons on what works and the challenges involved (e.g. integrating many medium-sized projects into the grid, managing subscriber billing, etc.). The state’s early mover status also means many competitors are already operating, which a new entrant must be mindful of.

Major Players and Competitors

Several companies – both national and regional – are active in offering roof-leasing and shared solar services. These include specialized community solar developers, large clean energy firms, and even some utilities or utility-affiliated programs. Below we profile key players and initiatives relevant to Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado:
	•	Solar Landscape (National) – A leading community solar developer known for scaling the rooftop model. Based in New Jersey, Solar Landscape has evolved from a solar installer to a turnkey developer and long-term owner of community solar assets, focusing on leasing commercial roofs. As of 2023, the company leases over 150 million square feet of rooftops nationwide, hosting about 1.5 GW of solar capacity that supplies over 262,000 households . Solar Landscape typically acts “like another tenant” to landlords, paying rent for roof space . They have executed large portfolio deals with REITs and corporations – for example, partnerships with Extra Space Storage, Public Storage, and Prologis in states like NJ, MD, and IL have resulted in multi-megawatt rooftop community solar projects  . Relevance: Solar Landscape is not yet active in TX/NM/CO (they focus on states with established programs), but they exemplify the potential scale of this model. If policies open up, companies of this caliber could enter these states. Their success shows that leasing roofs for community solar can be a gigawatt-scale business when conditions are right.
	•	SunShare (Colorado-based) – One of the first community solar companies in the nation, founded in Colorado in 2011. SunShare has developed more than 90 community solar gardens totaling over 140 MW, serving thousands of subscribers (residential and commercial) . They started in Colorado and expanded to markets like Minnesota. SunShare often partners with local governments and organizations; for instance, they have built projects subscribed by city agencies and residents in Denver and Colorado Springs. They typically use ground sites but have shown flexibility in siting. Relevance: In Colorado, SunShare is a household name in community solar. They demonstrate strong execution on subscriber acquisition and project development. A mid-sized installer entering this space in Colorado might encounter SunShare as a formidable competitor or potentially a partner (SunShare, like many developers, subcontracts local EPCs to build their projects). Their longevity in Colorado also means they understand the policy terrain deeply.
	•	Pivot Energy (Colorado-based) – A Denver-headquartered solar developer and subscriber management company. Pivot has carved out a niche in community solar for commercial and industrial (C&I) clients and was instrumental in Colorado’s community solar growth. They have developed dozens of community solar projects in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, and elsewhere. Pivot also offers a technology platform for managing subscriptions (they sometimes act as the subscriber organization for other developers). Notably, Pivot Energy was acquired by ECP in 2022, giving it greater financial backing for expansion. Relevance: Pivot is active in Colorado and has likely pursued opportunities in New Mexico’s solicitations. They are known for innovative deals – e.g. facilitating Colorado’s first *“off-site net metering” deal for a corporate client (the CU Boulder 5 MW project) . For a mid-sized entrant, Pivot could be both a competitor (in project development bids) and a potential collaborator (they might buy projects or use local installers for construction).
	•	Affordable Solar Group (New Mexico) – A regional solar EPC turned developer based in Albuquerque, NM. Affordable Solar has been a top installer in New Mexico for years (particularly for commercial and government projects) and has now moved into the community solar arena. They were successful in the first NM community solar RFP: Affordable Solar is the subscriber organization for multiple winning projects (for example, the “Wings for Life” Community Solar project in Las Cruces is being developed by Affordable Solar , and they have several projects around Albuquerque as well  ). Their local presence and experience with New Mexico’s Renewable Energy Industries Association give them insight into state policy and interconnection challenges. Relevance: In NM, Affordable Solar is a key competitor for any newcomer. However, they might also require subcontractors or partners for installing the large pipeline of projects they’ve taken on – a possible opportunity for a mid-sized install team to provide services. Their success shows the advantage of local knowledge and relationships in navigating state programs.
	•	CVE Group (International) – A global renewable energy developer (originating from France) that has aggressively entered the U.S. community solar market, including New Mexico. CVE’s subsidiary (identified in NM bid results as “Lower Rio Grande Solar LLC” with a CVE Group contact ) secured at least one project in NM. CVE has done community solar in states like Massachusetts and is now eyeing the Southwest. Relevance: Illustrates that well-capitalized foreign players are looking at these opportunities, bringing experience and funding. They often partner with local firms for EPC work.
	•	SunVest (National) – SunVest (SVOE LLC in NM’s list  and further down ) is a U.S. developer (based in the Midwest) that won projects in New Mexico. They specialize in small utility-scale and community solar. Relevance: Another example of a national player in the NM market.
	•	CSolPower/SunShare – The NM bid list shows “CSolPower LLC” with contacts at mysunshare.com   – clearly SunShare (CO) extended its reach into NM and won projects. Relevance: Established Colorado developers like SunShare are leveraging their expertise in new states, meaning competition in NM includes experienced firms from other markets.
	•	Pluma LLC and Others (New Mexico local) – Several lesser-known entities like Pluma LLC and Los Ebanistas Inc. appeared in NM’s winners list  . These could be local development companies or partnerships formed to participate in the program (possibly teaming local businesses with outside capital). Relevance: Some may be new entrants themselves, indicating an evolving competitive landscape. A savvy mid-sized installer might find partnership opportunities with such entities who have projects but need execution support.
	•	Utilities and Programs: In Texas, as noted, Austin Energy and CPS Energy themselves are key players by enabling roof-leasing/shared solar models. Austin Energy’s program effectively makes it an off-taker for third-party roof projects , and CPS’s SolarHost made the utility the lessee of customer roofs . Any company in Texas pursuing this model will likely work with such utility programs or, in the competitive market, with Retail Electric Providers (for energy offtake). For example, an independent project in Houston might need a partnership with a REP willing to buy the rooftop solar output and credit it to subscribers.
	•	Other Notables:
	•	PowerFin Partners (TX) – A small Texas developer that executed the CPS SolarHost project . They demonstrated how a mid-sized firm can partner with a utility to deploy rooftop solar at scale.
	•	UGE International (NYSE: UGE) – A developer specializing in commercial rooftop community solar (active in New York and other states). UGE actively seeks building owners to host projects, touting benefits like long-term lease income and energy savings for the community . They’re an example of a mid-sized player carving out a rooftop niche (though they are not yet in the target states, their model could port over if policy allows).
	•	Nexamp (MA-based) – One of the largest community solar providers in the U.S. (over 400 MW developed). They focus on owning/operating solar farms (ground and some roof) and enrolling subscribers. While Nexamp is not yet active in NM or TX (and Colorado’s earlier program size was perhaps too small for their scale), they could enter if opportunities expand. They have national retail clients (e.g. Walmart subscribes to Nexamp farms  ).
	•	Arcadia, Perch, Solstice – These are subscriber management companies that partner with project developers to handle customer acquisition and billing for community solar. For instance, Solstice (recently acquired by MyPower) has a presence in NM, noting they have “30,000 customers nationwide” and are bringing community solar to El Paso Electric and SPS utility customers in New Mexico . For a mid-sized installer who might not have marketing/billing capacity, teaming up with such firms could be crucial to succeed in shared solar.

In conclusion, the competitive landscape features a mix of nationally scaled community solar companies, local solar firms moving up the value chain, and utility-driven initiatives. Table 1 provides a snapshot of select players and their activities:

Table 1 – Select Companies and Initiatives in Roof-Leasing/Shared Solar

Company / Program	Description & Focus	Activity in TX, NM, CO	Notable Projects
Solar Landscape (NJ)	Leases commercial roofs for community solar (1.5 GW on 150m sq.ft.) . Partnered with REITs (Prologis, ExtraSpace) to use warehouse roofs.	Not in TX/NM/CO yet (focus on NJ, MD, IL, etc.), but a model entrant if policy opens.	6.5 MW on Extra Space Storage roofs in NJ (powers ~1,400 homes) ; 2.7 MW on Prologis roof in NJ .
SunShare (CO)	Pioneering community solar developer (since 2011). Turnkey developer-owner serving residential and commercial subscribers.	Colorado (major); Entered NM (won projects); also MN.	~144 MW across 90+ projects in CO/MN . Denver-area community solar gardens serving ~6,000+ customers.
Pivot Energy (CO)	Developer and subscription manager focusing on C&I solar and community solar portfolios. Offers software for subscriber management.	Colorado (major); likely pursuing NM; other states (IL, MA, NY).	8.9 MW portfolio in CO (11 sites, all ground-mount) ; 5 MW solar project for CU Boulder via virtual net metering (with SB 21-261).
Affordable Solar (NM)	Local EPC turned community solar developer. Strong NM presence, focusing on state’s program.	New Mexico (won several projects in 2023); also EPC for other projects.

PowerFin & SolarHost (TX)	Small TX developer partnered with CPS Energy to implement SolarHost roof-leasing pilot. Focus on utility partnership model.	Texas (San Antonio). Possibly seeking expansion if other utilities adopt similar programs.	10 MW SolarHost program (about 500 rooftops) in San Antonio  – hosts get credits, developer (PowerFin) owns systems under PPA to CPS.
CVE Group (Int’l)	International IPP entering US community solar (via subsidiaries). Brings strong financing.	New Mexico (1+ projects won, ~5 MW); exploring other states.	Lower Rio Grande Solar 5 MW project in NM (CVE’s project) . Previously built community solar in MA (~20 MW).
Arcadia, Solstice, Perch (Various)	Specialized subscriber management and energy services companies; they aggregate customers for community solar projects.	Active as partners in CO (Arcadia manages many Xcel subscribers), NM (Solstice enrolling EPE/SPS customers ), and elsewhere.	Arcadia manages tens of thousands of community solar subscriptions across 12+ states; Solstice (MyPower) engaged with NM program roll-out in 2024.

Table Notes: These examples illustrate the range from utility programs to private developers. Market activity is fluid – e.g., new winners in NM include other firms not listed (SunVest, NextEra’s DG arm, etc.), and Texas may see new entrants if policy changes. The key takeaway is that Colorado has the most entrenched players (some now moving to NM), New Mexico is attracting a who’s-who of community solar developers due to its new program, and Texas has mainly utility-led efforts so far, but one should watch for any competitive retail providers or third parties attempting innovative offerings.

Market Size and Growth in Each State

The roof-leasing/shared solar business model’s market share varies widely between Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, largely reflecting each state’s policy environment:
	•	Texas: By far the largest solar state of the three in terms of overall capacity (Texas has gigawatts of utility-scale solar installed ), but the community solar/roof-leasing segment is tiny in comparison. There is no official tally of “community solar” in Texas since no statewide program exists. The notable capacity comes from municipal utility programs: CPS Energy’s SolarHost pilot (10 MW AC)  and Austin Energy’s nascent program (just launching, target capacity not yet specified but likely aiming for tens of MW). Outside those, some co-ops have built small community solar farms (typically 0.5–1 MW each, often ground-mounted). For instance, Bandera Electric Coop built a 1 MW community solar farm for its members; similar efforts might total only a few megawatts statewide. Market share: Essentially negligible relative to Texas’s ~16 GW of total solar (mostly utility-scale) as of 2024. Growth rate: Historically low in this segment, but with Austin’s 2024 program, growth could tick up. For example, if Austin Energy were to add say 20 MW of rooftop community solar in 2025–26, that would significantly expand Texas’s shared solar footprint. Likewise, if CPS revives or expands SolarHost, or if other city utilities (like Houston’s municipal power in some areas, or co-ops) adopt similar models, we could see a modest increase. Overall, until broader enabling policies are in place, Texas’s growth in this niche will depend on a handful of localized programs – meaning market share will remain small (<1% of state solar capacity). However, interest in ERCOT’s evolving market (with potential for aggregated distributed resources) could spur new models by 2025–2026 (see Policy section).
	•	New Mexico: At present (2024), market size is effectively 0 MW operational, since the community solar program is just starting. But the pipeline is substantial: ~200 MW AC of community solar projects have been awarded and are in development . The PRC recently expanded the program cap to 500 MW (from the initial 200 MW) to be allocated by 2026  . This means New Mexico’s community/shared solar capacity could grow from 0 to up to 500 MW within just a few years – a remarkable growth curve if realized. Already, 45 projects totaling 200 MW are aiming for completion by 2025–2026  (though some delays into 2027 are possible due to interconnection challenges). Market share: Compared to NM’s overall solar capacity (~1 GW, mostly utility-scale), 200–500 MW of community solar would be a significant slice. It indicates the state’s intention for community solar to make up perhaps 15–30% of distributed solar in the near term. Growth rate: Essentially exponential in the short term – from nothing to hundreds of MW, which could be near a 100%+ CAGR over the next 2–3 years. The limiting factors will be how quickly projects can overcome interconnection and construction bottlenecks (discussed in Barriers). By 2026, NM could lead the nation in per capita community solar if all goes well. The growth trajectory beyond the 500 MW cap will depend on program success and legislative support, but given the interest (400+ proposals came in for initial round) , the demand is there for further expansion.
	•	Colorado: Colorado’s community solar market is moderate-sized and mature, with ~272 MW_DC (~200 MW_AC) as of 2023  . This represented roughly 5% of Colorado’s total solar capacity (Colorado had about 4–5 GW of solar including large utility projects). Over the last decade, community solar in CO grew steadily but not explosively – adding a few tens of MW per year under Xcel’s program. For example, after the initial 6 MW pilot in 2012, Xcel added around 30 MW in 2014–2016 (after a program expansion in 2016)  and continued with incremental RFPs each year. By 2020, capacity was around 100–150 MW, and by 2023 roughly 200 MW. Growth rate: Historically single-digit percentage of total solar annually, but that is poised to change. In 2024, Colorado passed SB 24-207 which modernizes and expands the community solar garden program. The law requires Xcel and Black Hills Energy to offer at least 53.5 MW of new community solar capacity each year in 2026 and 2027 (totaling ≥107 MW) , with higher minimums for low-income participation. This mandate roughly doubles the annual deployment rate compared to recent years. So we can expect a growth spurt: possibly 50% increase in cumulative capacity over 2025–2027. By end of 2027, CO might have ~300–350 MW of community solar operational. In the grand scheme, community solar will still be a fraction of Colorado’s solar (as utility-scale projects are booming too), but its market share will grow. Also, if utilities or third parties seize on new allowances (like 10 MW project size on preferred sites), a few very large rooftop projects could appear, boosting capacity. Colorado’s community solar is also diversifying: more projects in rural co-op territories (voluntary programs), and municipal initiatives like Denver’s solar gardens on city roofs, which add to the total outside the Xcel program.

Comparative Insight: Colorado currently leads in deployed shared solar capacity among the three states, but New Mexico is catching up fast with an aggressive program roll-out. Texas lags due to policy constraints. By 2026, New Mexico’s community solar capacity could rival or exceed Colorado’s if the 300–500 MW pipeline comes through, whereas Texas will remain largely on the sidelines unless new policies unlock its massive potential roof market.

One way to visualize the disparity is to compare community solar capacity per 1 million state residents (a rough metric for market penetration): Colorado (5.8 million people) has ~272 MW_DC – about 47 MW per million people. New Mexico (2.1 million) with 200 MW would be 95 MW per million if fully built – potentially the highest ratio in the country. Texas (29 million people) has maybe ~15 MW of true community/shared solar (Austin + CPS programs) – which is <1 MW per million. This stark contrast highlights how important state policy is to this business model’s growth.

Policy and Regulatory Framework

The viability of roof-leasing and shared solar models is heavily dependent on policy frameworks. Key factors include net metering and virtual net metering rules, interconnection and grid access policies, utility program structures, and incentive schemes. Here we break down the relevant policy landscape in Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, emphasizing how each state’s laws govern (or hinder) these models.

Texas: Policy Landscape in a Deregulated Market

Net Metering: Texas is unique in that it has no statewide net metering mandate. Instead, net metering or buyback credit policies are determined by individual utilities or retail electric providers. In the deregulated parts of Texas (served by ERCOT and competitive retailers), some retail providers voluntarily offer credit for excess solar generation (often at a rate lower than the retail price), while others do not . For example, a homeowner in Dallas with rooftop solar might choose a REP plan that credits exported kWh at near retail rates, effectively simulating net metering – but this is a matter of contract, not law. In municipal utility territories (Austin, CPS, etc.) and electric co-ops, policies vary: many munis and co-ops do offer net metering or at least avoided-cost buyback for distributed solar. However, there is no uniform guarantee. This patchwork means that selling power to the grid from a leased roof can be unpredictable in terms of compensation. Austin Energy’s new program sidesteps this by using a standard offer PPA (the utility just pays for all kWh produced), and CPS’s program similarly was based on a fixed PPA price with the utility.

Virtual Net Metering (VNM) / Shared Solar Regulations: Texas does not have a general provision for virtual net metering or meter aggregation for multiple customers. This is a significant policy gap – without VNM, it’s difficult to credit multiple tenants or subscribers from one solar array. That said, some workarounds and special cases exist:
	•	In multi-tenant properties, a building owner could install solar and allocate the output to tenants by lowering their rent or using sub-meters, but the utility will still typically see one master meter. True virtual net metering (where each tenant’s utility bill gets a portion of solar credit) is not standard in Texas. The quote from a Texas legal blog sums it up: “the lack of clear statewide policies for solar access in rental properties has left many tenants unable to take advantage of solar benefits” . Landlords can install a shared solar system and technically distribute energy internally, but doing so crosses into being a mini utility unless carefully structured. For example, one could structure it such that the landlord is the single buyer of the solar (reducing common area electric costs) and then passes savings to tenants indirectly.
	•	Community solar in the sense of an independent developer selling to many subscribers is generally not allowed in ERCOT because it would involve selling electricity to retail customers without a retail license. The only practical way has been via a municipally sanctioned program or by the developer becoming a REP (a high bar) or partnering with one.

ERCOT Grid Access: ERCOT (which covers most of Texas) has an open wholesale market. A distributed solar project (like on a roof) can, in theory, register as a generation resource and sell power into the ERCOT wholesale market. However, ERCOT protocols currently treat small distributed generators (<1 MW) as negative load rather than individual market participants. Larger distributed generators (>1 MW) can register, but the process is complex and typically not worth it for a few megawatts unless part of an aggregation. ERCOT has been working on integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) more effectively (for example, contemplating an aggregation model under FERC Order 2222), but as of 2025 the frameworks are still evolving . Practically, a roof solar project in ERCOT could do one of the following:
	•	Sell to a REP via PPA: Some projects have used a three-party PPA where the solar developer, the customer (off-taker), and a Retail Electric Provider enter an agreement. One example: a 2.6 MW solar PPA for a manufacturing plant in Seguin, TX involved the developer (Ameresco) and the customer using a retail provider (MP2 Energy) as the conduit . The REP effectively handles the energy flow and billing, allowing a third-party PPA in a deregulated setting. For a community solar model, one could imagine a REP offering a “community solar plan” where it buys the output of a third-party rooftop project and gives bill credits to its subscribers. This is not common yet, but it’s conceptually possible if a REP sees a market niche.
	•	Qualify as a QF (Qualifying Facility): Under PURPA, a small solar project could force the interconnecting utility (TDSP in ERCOT) to buy its power at an avoided cost. But in ERCOT’s competitive market, PURPA is less straightforward, and avoided cost is basically the market price. So you’d just be a price-taker on the wholesale market – not very lucrative at current prices (which average a few cents per kWh, though with volatility).
	•	Join ERCOT’s DER pilot: ERCOT’s DER roadmap includes allowing aggregated DERs to provide services. If that materializes by 2025–2026, a developer could aggregate many rooftop systems and bid them as a resource for energy or ancillary services . This is still a nascent area and more relevant for storage or flexible load, but it’s worth noting as a future opportunity.

Third-Party PPAs Legality: In Texas, third-party ownership of solar is allowed (unlike some states that have restrictions). A customer can sign a PPA to buy power from panels on their property owned by someone else – this has been done for large commercial sites in deregulated areas (with a REP facilitating as noted). However, municipal utilities can prohibit third-party sales in their territory (Austin Energy does – they require the customer to only buy power from the city utility) . So in Austin, for instance, you can’t do a private PPA – which is why Austin Energy’s own program fills that role. In San Antonio, similarly, you must buy from CPS. In Oncor or CenterPoint areas, you can choose any REP, so you could choose one that cooperates with a third-party solar deal.

Utility Programs & Barriers: Texas has some idiosyncratic barriers:
	•	Franchise Laws: Only utilities or certified retail providers can resell electricity. So, if a solar company tried to put panels on an apartment and directly charge each tenant for the solar power, that could be viewed as illegally acting as a utility. The common workaround is the “master meter + rent” approach, but that isn’t true VNM, just an economic arrangement.
	•	Interconnection: Texas has reasonably straightforward interconnection standards for distributed generation, especially in ERCOT (no additional fees for small systems, etc.). But for larger projects (>1 MW), interconnection studies are needed even at distribution level. Some distribution providers might require network upgrades for large DG, which can be costly. Oncor, for example, evaluates big rooftop projects on a case-by-case basis (though few have been attempted).
	•	Policy trend: Unfortunately, recent Texas policy has been hostile toward renewables. In 2023–2025, the legislature considered (and nearly passed) bills that would impose additional costs or requirements on renewable generators (like requiring solar farms to have equivalent backup from gas plants, etc.) . These anti-renewable bills did not pass in 2025 – a relief for the industry – but they could reappear in the 2027 session  . While these were aimed mostly at large projects, a climate of hostility could indirectly affect incentives or add permitting hurdles even for smaller projects. Notably, Texas already ended its state property tax abatement program (Chapter 313) for renewables; new proposals sought to levy fees on solar and wind. None specifically targeted community solar (since it’s virtually non-existent in TX), but any requirement for renewables to “firm” output or other punitive rules would hurt the economics of all solar models.
	•	On the flip side, local policies in Austin and San Antonio are supportive (as seen with dedicated programs). Also, Texas has a strong property rights and contract law environment: if a developer and building owner sign a lease, and a REP agrees to credit subscribers, there’s actually freedom to try creative models in ERCOT’s market – it just hasn’t been done at scale yet. The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) hasn’t set rules for community solar, so any project will need to navigate within existing retail market rules.

Incentives: Texas doesn’t offer state tax credits for solar. However, solar equipment is exempt from state sales tax, and importantly, Texas property tax code allows a 100% property tax exemption for the added value of a solar energy device installed on property . This exemption applies to any “solar or wind-powered energy device” on residential, commercial, or industrial property, used for on-site energy needs. If a third-party owns the system, it should still qualify so long as the device is on the property and providing energy (even if that energy is exported). This helps ensure that adding panels doesn’t increase the host building’s tax appraisal. There is also a federal incentive environment (discussed under Incentives below) that affects Texas projects equally.

In summary for Texas: The policy framework is challenging – no VNM, no state mandate for community solar, varied net metering, and a need to work within the competitive market. The bright spots are local utility programs and the general freedom in ERCOT to structure deals if you can find willing partners. Legislative changes in 2025–2026 are not currently expected to expand opportunities (the momentum in the state capitol has been in the opposite direction), so progress will likely come from municipal initiatives and creative private arrangements rather than state law.

New Mexico: Community Solar Act and Supportive Policies

Community Solar Act (2021) and Program Rules: New Mexico’s policy environment for shared solar is now defined by the Community Solar Act (SB 84, 2021) and subsequent PRC rules. Key features of this framework:
	•	Cap and Allocation: Initially, the program allows 200 MW AC total of community solar across the IOU service areas until Nov 2024 . This was split as 125 MW for PNM (northern NM), 45 MW for SPS/Xcel (eastern NM), and 30 MW for El Paso Electric (southern NM) . In late 2024, seeing the interest, the PRC used its authority to raise the cap by an additional 300 MW, effectively moving the cap to 500 MW . The PRC can continue to adjust the cap in future years as it reviews the program.
	•	Low-Income Carve-out: The law requires at least 30% of each project’s capacity be reserved for low-income (LMI) subscribers . The PRC rules even noted that most selected projects committed to 50% or more LMI share . LMI subscribers must get a minimum 20% bill discount (the Act specifies a 20% discount on bill credits; many projects offered ~30% in bids) . This is a substantial equity provision – it means project economics are designed to pass significant savings to low-income households.
	•	Subscriber Definitions: Residential and small commercial subscribers can subscribe up to a certain amount of their usage (typically 120% of historical usage). No single subscriber can take more than 40% of a project’s output, and a project must have at least 10 subscribers. These are standard rules to ensure broad participation.
	•	Virtual Net Metering / Bill Credit: The utilities (PNM, SPS, EPE) are required to provide bill credits to subscribers for their share of community solar production. The value of the credit – the Solar Bill Credit – was a point of contention. The Act left it to the PRC to determine a just and reasonable credit rate. The PRC’s draft had it roughly at the utility’s retail rate minus certain non-bypassable charges, but utilities argued for much lower (avoided cost). This was being litigated; in 2024 the PRC had not finalized the exact credit formula  . Regardless, once determined, the credit will appear on subscriber bills, and the utility will purchase the community solar energy from the developer at that credit rate (or charge the developer for the credits – effectively same thing). Importantly, the Act allows credits to be carried over month to month if not used (no forfeiting excess too quickly) .
	•	Interconnection: The PRC implemented rules to streamline interconnection for community solar projects (which are <=5 MW). However, as we’ve seen, the IOUs identified significant grid upgrade requirements. By rule, upgrade costs fall on the developers (no socialization of costs yet, though there are moves to use some grant funds – see Solar for All below). The utilities must complete interconnection studies in a timely manner, but there have been delays (and even interim “supplemental reviews” needed) . Despite this, New Mexico generally has a clear path for projects to connect at distribution level, if they pay for needed upgrades.

Net Metering (traditional): Separate from community solar, NM has had net metering for customer-sited solar for years. Investor-owned utilities are required to net meter customer-owned systems up to 120% of that customer’s annual consumption. Excess generation credits carry over month to month, and any left at year-end are granted to the utility (no cash payout). This exists, but it applies to one customer behind one meter. Virtual net metering between different customers wasn’t allowed until the community solar program. So effectively, traditional net metering helps individual solar owners, while community solar (with bill credits) helps shared systems. The net metering policy is reasonably friendly and has helped rooftop solar grow in NM, but it’s separate from the new shared solar market.

Grid Access and Utility Attitude: The three IOUs in NM are regulated by the PRC and were initially resistant to the community solar Act. They raised concerns about grid capacity and cost shifts. For example, after the first RFP, PNM reported that 8 of the projects needed significant substation transformer upgrades (causing delays) , and SPS indicated likely interconnection delays too . The PRC recognized these as growing pains. Notably, in October 2024, when expanding the cap, the IOUs opposed the expansion , but the Commission went ahead, citing momentum and demand for the program. To mitigate interconnection barriers, New Mexico is leveraging federal funds (see next point).

Incentives and Grants: New Mexico has put itself in a position to capture new federal support:
	•	The state won a $156 million “Solar for All” grant from the U.S. EPA in 2024  . This is part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (Inflation Reduction Act) targeting low-income solar. The NM Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) will administer this. The funds will support various solar projects for LMI households. Crucially, one component is funding for larger “community solar” projects that benefit entire neighborhoods or multi-family buildings . The grant can potentially be used to buy down the cost of community solar projects – for example, covering the expensive grid upgrades or subsidizing higher discounts for low-income subscribers. The PRC indicated that about $18 million of this could create a pool to offset interconnection upgrade costs for some projects  . This grant, therefore, enhances the policy framework by adding financial support to overcome barriers.
	•	New Mexico also reinstated a state solar tax credit a few years ago, called the Solar Market Development Tax Credit. It provides a 10% credit (up to $6,000) for solar installed on a residence, business, or farm . However, this likely applies only to customer-owned systems on their property. A third-party developer putting solar on someone else’s roof wouldn’t directly qualify (the host could claim it if they own the system, but in a lease/PPA they wouldn’t). Thus, for roof-leasing models, this tax credit may not be very relevant unless a structure is arranged to pass benefits to the host.
	•	Another incentive: NM allows renewable energy systems to count toward utilities’ RPS compliance. Community solar RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates) presumably can be retained or transferred. There’s discussion in PRC dockets about REC handling for community solar (to avoid double counting in the RPS) . The value of RECs in NM isn’t very high, but it’s something developers consider in financing.

Utility Renewable Programs: New Mexico’s policy also has specific programs like PNM’s “Solar Direct” (utility-scale solar for large customers) and various USDA-funded solar projects on co-op systems. Co-ops (which are not under PRC jurisdiction for community solar) may implement their own shared solar voluntarily. Kit Carson Electric Coop, for instance, has built solar gardens to achieve 100% daytime solar for its territory. Those aren’t formal subscription programs, more like the co-op just supplying solar to everyone. The reason this matters: a mid-sized installer might find opportunities outside the IOU program by working directly with co-ops or municipalities who want to do community-scale solar. While SB84 focuses on IOUs, it doesn’t prevent other utilities from similar efforts.

Net Metering for multi-tenant (on-site): If a mid-sized installer wanted to put solar on, say, an apartment in NM and directly help the tenants, could they? Virtual net metering outside the official program is not established, but the building owner could use the solar for common areas and perhaps aggregate usage if they have multiple meters on contiguous property (some states allow meter aggregation for one owner – not sure NM specifics). Generally, the new Act is the mechanism for shared solar across different customer accounts.

Future Policy Changes: The major expected changes revolve around:
	•	Successfully implementing the expanded cap (500 MW) and possibly making the program permanent beyond “pilot.” The initial Act was a “pilot” with PRC discretion after 2024. By 2025–26, the legislature might codify an ongoing program if it’s going well, or increase the cap further.
	•	Adjusting the bill credit rate: If the PRC sets a credit too low, it might dampen developer interest or subscriber savings; too high and utilities will complain of cost shifts. This balance will likely be re-evaluated, especially as projects come online and actual performance data emerges.
	•	Including co-ops/munis: There may be interest in expanding community solar to rural electric cooperatives (perhaps via incentives or voluntary programs). Also, compatibility with tribal utilities could be explored (tribal lands often have their own utilities; partnerships might emerge to use community solar for tribal benefit).

Overall, New Mexico’s policy framework is very supportive of shared solar, with deliberate provisions for equity and a controlled roll-out. It is arguably one of the most promising new markets in the country for this model. The main governance is by the PRC, which seems inclined to nurture the program (as evidenced by raising the cap and seeking solutions to issues). For a mid-sized installer, NM provides a clear avenue to participate (via becoming a “subscriber organization” or partnering with one) under transparent rules. The combination of state policy and federal support (Solar for All grant, ITC bonuses) makes the economics potentially attractive, albeit with hurdles like upgrade costs that must be managed.

Colorado: Evolved Community Solar Policy with Recent Expansion

Community Solar Gardens Act (2010) and Evolution: Colorado’s framework originates from the 2010 act that made it the first state to authorize community solar gardens (CSGs). Key provisions included:
	•	Allowing third-party developers to build solar gardens up to 2 MW (later increased) and requiring investor-owned utilities to purchase the output and provide bill credits to subscribers.
	•	CSGs had to have at least 10 subscribers, no subscriber over 40% of capacity, and subscribers had to be in the same utility service territory (and same or adjacent county initially, which was later relaxed).
	•	Xcel Energy (the largest IOU) was directed to acquire a certain small amount of CSG capacity (initially 6 MW/yr) . This was a modest start.

Over time, through PUC proceedings and settlements, the program grew:
	•	In 2016, a settlement with Xcel expanded the CSG program by an additional 117 MW over a few years . This also introduced a 15% low-income carve-out for those new gardens  – one of the earlier LMI requirements in the country.
	•	The max project size was increased to 5 MW (standard) and even larger if co-located on certain sites.
	•	The subscriber geographic requirement was eased (now subscribers just need to be in same utility territory).
	•	Bill credit rates were defined in utility tariffs: Xcel uses the “Solar*Rewards Community” tariff, where subscriber credits are roughly the retail rate minus certain riders if the project developer does not take an up-front REC payment. There were options where Xcel would pay a one-time incentive per kW in exchange for RECs and then credit subscribers at a lower “avoided cost” rate. Many iterations occurred, but in general, developers preferred higher bill credits and no upfront incentive. Xcel’s current standard offer (for reference) credits subscribers at the retail energy rate plus a portion of distribution cost, etc., which comes out to around 7–10 cents/kWh credit (depending on rate class) – enough to typically give subscribers ~10% savings and developers a viable PPA price.
	•	Co-ops and municipal utilities in Colorado were not mandated by the 2010 Act to do community solar, but some chose to. The Colorado Energy Office even gave grants to co-ops to build small community solar for low-income members. Example: Holy Cross Energy (co-op) built several “Solar Garden” arrays and offers subscriptions, heavily focusing on local subscribers.

2023 Modernization – SB 24-207: In 2023 (technically signed in 2024), Colorado passed a significant update to its community solar policy (Senate Bill 24-207) . This law does a few important things:
	•	Expands annual capacity: It requires Xcel and Black Hills to each issue at least 53.5 MW of CSG awards in 2026 and again in 2027 . It sets a trajectory for continued procurement (and presumably, after 2027, the PUC can continue requiring capacity additions). This basically institutionalizes growth of the program, whereas before it was piecemeal through Xcel’s biennial resource plans.
	•	Project size and siting: It allows larger projects up to 10 MW AC if located on “preferred” sites or with agrivoltaics . Preferred sites likely include things like brownfields, former industrial sites, and possibly large rooftops or parking canopies – encouraging dual land use. Otherwise, 5 MW remains the cap for standard sites. This change opens the door to more economies of scale, especially if someone can use a big roof (e.g., 8 MW on a huge warehouse might now be feasible, whereas before 2–5 MW was the limit).
	•	Increased Low-Income Requirement: Now all new projects must reserve at least 51% of capacity for low- to moderate-income subscribers  (up from 5–15% previously). And the minimum discount for LMI customers is set at 25% on their bills , higher than before, aligning with federal IRA bonus credit criteria. Projects that secure the IRA low-income bonus credits have to provide even higher discounts (potentially 40-50%, depending on level of bonus)  . This ensures deeper savings for marginalized communities, at the cost of giving up more revenue – but presumably offset by federal incentives.
	•	Consumer Protection and Convenience: SB 24-207 mandates things like utility consolidated billing (so subscribers get one bill from the utility with credits netted, rather than separate bills from the solar company) . It also requires all customer agreements be available in Spanish and other languages, and allows easier income verification (self-attestation for LMI) . These might seem small, but they reduce soft costs and barriers to subscription.
	•	Agrivoltaics inclusion: The law interestingly integrates agrivoltaic projects (solar + agriculture) into the community solar program, allowing larger size for those. That likely won’t involve roofs, but it speaks to the state’s openness to innovation in shared solar, perhaps foreshadowing combinations like solar+storage gardens or other models down the line.

Net Metering (traditional): Colorado has strong net metering for individual customers. IOUs must net meter up to 120% of a customer’s annual usage. Excess rolls over indefinitely as a kilowatt-hour credit. Annually, if any leftover (rare if sized right) can be paid out at the utility’s average hourly incremental cost (pretty low) or credited forward. This solid net metering policy has helped rooftop solar, but it does not directly affect community solar except that it sets a benchmark for credit value (community solar credits try to mirror something close to retail rates so subscribers see similar benefits as if they had their own panels).

Interconnection and Grid: To date, integrating community solar in Colorado has been manageable but not without issues:
	•	Xcel Energy has had to handle ~100+ interconnections of 0.5–5 MW projects. There have been some queues and delays, but Xcel generally supported the program since it was mandated and they earn some incentives through Renewable Energy Plan compliance. However, developers in CO have reported that feeder capacity in some areas is getting constrained, and they face expensive upgrades or rejections in certain high-DG areas . This is not as severe as NM’s situation yet, but as more distributed projects come, it’s a factor. The PUC has been working on distribution grid planning to accommodate more DERs.
	•	Co-ops in Colorado sometimes have limits on how much DG can be on a feeder (for stability), and those could limit additional community solar in their territories unless upgrades are made. But since co-ops aren’t mandated, they self-manage this.
	•	Colorado’s relatively progressive stance means efforts are underway to enable grid modernization (e.g., smart inverters, storage pairing – Colorado now allows community solar projects to include storage, which could help mitigate grid impact by smoothing output).

Tax Incentives: Colorado provides a sales tax exemption for solar equipment for residential systems . It also has a property tax exemption for residential solar – the added value from a PV system on a home is not counted for property tax . For commercial systems, there isn’t a blanket state property tax exemption, but many community solar arrays are on leased land that might be taxed as personal property of the developer. Often, developers negotiate PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes) with counties for larger arrays. If a solar garden is on a roof, the question is whether it increases the building’s value for tax purposes; likely not if owned by a third party and removable. Colorado does offer a financing tool: the C-PACE program (Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy) which could, in theory, help an owner finance a solar project on their roof (though that’s for owner-owned systems, not leasing).

Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS): Colorado’s RPS indirectly supports community solar. Xcel and Black Hills get credit toward RPS for community solar RECs. Xcel historically would get RECs from community solar either by paying a small incentive or by the program design (some early projects sold RECs to Xcel). Now, with projects likely taking the IRA incentives, they might keep RECs (for fed compliance). But Colorado’s 30% by 2020 RPS (increased to 100% clean electricity by 2050 goal) means the state values distributed solar as part of its mix. Some PUC decisions favored community solar as a way to meet distributed generation carve-outs in the RPS.

Other Programs: In addition to the core community solar gardens, Colorado allows some specific arrangements:
	•	Solar*Connect (trial program by Xcel) that would have let customers subscribe to utility-owned solar assets – a form of “green tariff.” The PUC instead preferred keeping the third-party community solar model robust.
	•	Virtual Net Metering for certain entities: SB21-261 (2021) allowed universities, military bases, and other large customers to do off-site solar with virtual credits (which enabled the CU Boulder 5 MW deal). This is a niche but could be expanded to other large commercial multimeter customers. It essentially is a targeted VNM that a developer like Pivot used to sign a PPA with CU and then coordinate with Xcel to credit CU’s main campus meter from a solar array across town .

Future Outlook: Policy-wise, Colorado is at a stable yet expanding point:
	•	Implementation of SB24-207 will be key. The PUC will update rules to reflect new requirements, possibly adjusting how RFPs are run for those new MW. The law addresses many of the weak points (e.g., making sure low-income actually benefit, requiring utility billing integration, etc.). Execution will tell if those raise costs or lower friction.
	•	No major opposition is expected; the bill passed with support, and utilities seem to accept community solar as part of business now. One potential hitch could be if Xcel’s distribution system upgrades for 100+ MW more DER become significant – they might ask the PUC to allow cost-sharing for those upgrades (maybe socializing some costs rather than each project paying all).
	•	We might also see cooperatives pick up pace. La Plata Electric (a co-op in CO) announced in 2023 plans for a large community solar array to allow members to subscribe, because they are trying to exit their wholesale contract and source more local renewables. As co-ops renegotiate power supply (Tri-State G&T is loosening its hold), more local solar gardens could pop up voluntarily.
	•	Colorado’s emphasis on equitable access and integration (e.g., Spanish language requirement, etc.) shows a forward-looking approach that could further streamline customer acquisition (opening new customer segments).

In summary, Colorado’s regulatory framework for shared solar is robust and improving. It has the necessary ingredients: virtual crediting, mandates for utilities to buy output, consumer protections, and alignment with federal incentives. For anyone trying a roof-leasing shared solar model, Colorado provides clear rules on how to credit subscribers and size projects, though one must navigate competitive solicitations for capacity and possibly fierce competition for the best sites. The recent policy changes set the stage for growth in 2025–2027, making it an opportune time (and also a competitive time) to enter the market.

Incentives and Subsidies (Federal & Other)

Across all three states, the economics of roof-leasing and shared solar projects are significantly influenced by federal incentives and other funding programs. Here are the key incentives and how they play in:
	•	Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC): Commercial solar installations (which include community solar projects and third-party owned systems) qualify for the 30% ITC on capital costs. This is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, crucial for financing. For a mid-sized developer, utilizing the ITC usually means bringing in a tax equity investor unless the developer has sufficient tax appetite. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the ITC for solar remains at 30% through 2032. This is uniform for TX, NM, CO. Third-party owned rooftop systems in lease/PPA arrangements can take the ITC (the property owner cannot, since they didn’t buy the system). The ITC greatly improves project ROI and effectively subsidizes the cost of installations. A challenge for some mid-sized players is accessing tax equity – but with IRA’s Direct Pay option for tax-exempt entities and possibly transferable credits, there are new structures to ease this.
	•	IRA Bonus Credits: The IRA created several adder credits on top of the 30% ITC that are highly relevant to shared solar:
	•	Low-Income Community Bonus (up to +20%): For projects <= 5 MW AC that serve affordable housing or are part of a qualifying low-income economic benefit project, the ITC can increase by 10% or 20%. Specifically, if a project is located in a low-income community or on tribal land, that’s +10%. If it additionally is a Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project (meaning at least 50% of the financial benefits of the electricity go to LMI households), that’s +20% . Community solar projects that meet those criteria can get up to a 50% ITC (30% base + 20% bonus). Both New Mexico and Colorado are structuring their programs to qualify projects for this (hence the 30% or 51% low-income subscriber requirements and minimum discounts). For example, if a developer in NM offers 30% bill discounts to 60% low-income subscribers, that project can likely secure the 20% bonus ITC – hugely boosting its funding. This is effectively free money from the federal government to amplify community solar. The bonus is limited nationwide (there’s an annual MW cap per year for allocations), but NM’s projects and CO’s upcoming ones are vying for it. A mid-sized installer partnering on these projects should absolutely design to capture these credits.
	•	Domestic Content Bonus (+10%): If the project meets certain domestic manufacturing thresholds (e.g., solar modules, steel, etc. made in USA), a 10% ITC adder is available. Many community solar developers are aiming for this as well, though domestic solar panels are still slightly more expensive. If achieved, a project could have 30% + 20% (low-income) + 10% (domestic) = 60% ITC. That is almost unprecedented support, essentially covering more than half the project cost via tax credit. For roof-leasing models, domestic content might be feasible if using U.S.-made panels and racking.
	•	Energy Communities Bonus (+10%): If the project is in a designated “energy community” (e.g. certain brownfield sites or areas with significant fossil industry job loss), that’s another 10%. Parts of NM and CO (and TX) qualify. A clever developer might stack this too (though you can’t exceed 50% from low-income + 10% domestic + 10% energy comm = theoretically 50%+ but IRA caps low-income bonus projects to 50% I believe, aside from domestic? Actually need to confirm: the low-income bonus is separate from energy community, so conceivably could do 30+20+10+10 = 70%, but I think 50% is max for low-income category? The law is complex. At minimum 50-60% ITC total is achievable).
These bonus credits strongly favor projects that benefit low-income folks – aligning with NM and CO policy goals. Texas projects could also use them (for instance, if someone did a multifamily affordable housing solar and sold cheaply to tenants, that might qualify for 20% bonus, even if not in a formal state program). But the lack of a formal program makes it trickier to demonstrate that benefit distribution.
	•	MACRS Depreciation: On top of ITC, commercial solar can use accelerated depreciation (5-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System). This can yield another ~20-25% of system cost in tax benefit (present value). Combined with ITC, typically ~50% of project cost is offset by tax benefits for a taxable entity. With bonus credits, that can climb to 70%+. This significantly lowers the required electricity price to make a project viable.
	•	USDA REAP Grants: The USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program provides grants (and loan guarantees) for renewable energy projects for rural small businesses and agricultural producers. The grants can cover up to 50% of project cost (recently increased from 25%). In TX/NM/CO, many potential host sites or subscriber organizations could qualify as rural businesses or farms. For example, a farmer with a big barn could lease his roof; if he were the applicant, a REAP grant might help fund the system (though if he’s not the owner of the system, it gets complex). More directly, a community solar developer could partner with a rural electric co-op or a local business to apply for REAP on a specific project that serves that community. REAP is competitive and often geared to smaller (<1 MW) projects, but it’s an avenue. NM’s state energy office might coordinate REAP with Solar for All funds to help rural community solar in co-op areas too.
	•	USDA “Solar for All” and Other Federal Programs: We discussed New Mexico’s $156M Solar for All grant . Colorado and Texas entities also applied for Solar for All grants (several awards were given around the country). The City of Denver got a $12 million Solar for All award, for instance, to support its municipal solar gardens for low-income residents . These grants effectively subsidize shared solar deployment costs and/or increase subscriber savings. The presence of such grants in NM and CO will improve the business case for projects that align with them (as some funds may cover interconnection upgrades or provide a backstop for LMI subscriber payments).
Additionally, the DOE’s National Community Solar Partnership and “Community Power Accelerator” provide technical assistance and even some financing to community solar projects that benefit disadvantaged communities . For instance, developers can get pre-development loans or inclusion into a pipeline for impact investors. While not direct cash like a grant, these resources can help a mid-sized firm with limited capital to play in this space.
	•	State-Level Incentives:
	•	Texas: None specific to shared solar (just the aforementioned property and sales tax breaks available to all solar). Some utilities offer one-time rebates for rooftop solar (like Oncor had a residential incentive, CPS has rebates, etc.), but those usually go to the host who buys a system, not applicable to third-party owned. Austin Energy and CPS provided performance-based incentives to solar owners historically, but now pivoting to their community programs. Texas also has the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing in many counties, which can help fund commercial solar by attaching cost to property tax bill. A developer could possibly use PACE to finance a host-owned system or to secure a lien for their investment on a building (if the owner is willing). Again, that’s more if the host is the borrower.
	•	New Mexico: As noted, a 10% state tax credit exists (max $6k) , which is mostly for small systems. NM also has property tax exclusions for solar in certain jurisdictions (some counties waive property tax for solar farms by treating them like pollution-control equipment or via industrial revenue bonds). Community solar developers may negotiate PILOT agreements with counties. For example, if a solar garden is built on private land, developers often use county-issued bonds to get property tax exemption in exchange for PILOT fees. This isn’t a legislated incentive, but a common practice in NM and CO for larger projects.
	•	Colorado: No state tax credit, but some local incentives (e.g., holy cross co-op pays bonus for local solar, etc.). The main “incentive” is that Xcel used to offer upfront REC payments to community solar bids that were lower, but nowadays, competition drives bid prices and no additional state money is given. Given the IRA, Colorado might not need to add state incentives; instead they put mandates on discounts which implicitly assume developers will leverage federal credits to cover those.

In essence, federal incentives under the IRA are a game-changer for this business model. They significantly improve the profitability of projects that align with public policy goals (domestic manufacturing, low-income benefit). A mid-sized installer entering this space should structure their projects to capture these incentives: e.g., target low-income customer segments (to get the bonus ITC), consider projects in eligible geographies (energy communities), and procure equipment that meets domestic content thresholds if possible. They should also explore partnerships to utilize grants like Solar for All or REAP, which can further reduce capital costs or allow deeper savings to attract subscribers.

One should also be aware of environmental attribute markets – e.g., selling RECs from community solar to voluntary buyers. In Texas, a project could sell its RECs in the ERCOT market (although prices are very low for generic RECs). In NM and CO, RECs may be transferred to utilities for RPS compliance (some contracts might give a small payment for them). It’s not a huge revenue source currently, but if a corporate off-taker is interested, there could be a play where a company leases a roof and in return gets claim to RECs for sustainability goals.

Finally, USDA and DOE loan programs (like the Loan Programs Office) are increasingly looking to finance distributed energy projects (especially with storage) at low rates. A portfolio of roof-leased solar sites could potentially be aggregated and financed through green banks or USDA loans, giving low-cost capital – an angle for scaling up.

In summary, the incentives environment is very favorable, especially in NM and CO where projects will stack IRA bonuses. Texas projects can use the same federal incentives, but without state support, a Texas project might have to rely solely on federal 30% ITC + maybe domestic content, which could be thinner margins if selling at wholesale. Meanwhile, an NM project could effectively be 50% subsidized and selling at retail credit – far more lucrative. This disparity again points to focusing efforts where policy and incentives align.

Barriers and Challenges

Despite the attractive opportunities, several barriers – logistical, legal, and financial – exist for roof-leasing and shared solar models. Understanding these challenges is crucial for developing a viable strategy. Below is a breakdown of key barriers in Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado (many are common across states, though severity varies):

1. Logistical & Technical Barriers:
	•	Roof Suitability and Infrastructure: Not every roof is solar-ready. A commercial flat roof must have sufficient structural capacity to support the weight of panels and racks (plus wind loads). Older roofs may need reinforcement. Roof age is a factor too: if a roof will need replacement in 5 years, a solar developer will either avoid it or require the owner to re-roof upfront (or factor in a mid-life array removal and reinstallation, which adds cost). Additionally, roof penetrations vs. ballasted systems must be considered to avoid leaks. These issues can complicate negotiations with property owners (they worry about leaks, warranty voids, etc.). A mid-sized installer needs a plan for roof assessments and perhaps offering to include a new roof membrane as part of the deal.
	•	Interconnection Constraints: Getting the solar array connected to the grid at the building’s location can be a hurdle. Many urban distribution networks have limited backfeed capacity. As seen in New Mexico, the first batch of projects faced about $122 million in required distribution system upgrades (like new transformers, reconductoring lines, etc.) across 45 projects   – averaging nearly $2.7M per project, which is substantial. This was a significant barrier; without mitigation, some projects would not be financially feasible due to these extra upgrade costs  . While NM is seeking to offset some of these with grants, it illustrates the risk: you might find a perfect roof, but the local feeder or substation can’t handle the output without expensive upgrades (which typically the project must pay for). In Colorado, developers similarly report feeders in Denver or other areas getting saturated, leading to high upgrade quotes or being forced to locate projects further out. Early engagement with utilities to study interconnection feasibility is thus essential. Small projects (say 100 kW on a strip mall roof) usually don’t trigger big upgrades, but multi-MW community solar can.
	•	Multi-tenant Wiring: If the goal is to directly serve tenants in the same building (like in an apartment or multi-business strip), there’s a logistical challenge of splitting the solar output behind the meter. Without virtual net metering in TX for instance, one might set up a private wiring arrangement: either all units fed by a common solar-fed supply (complicated in existing buildings), or using smart submeters to allocate credits internally. This can be technically complex and potentially not allowed by code if not a utility. Thus, practically many shared solar projects opt to send energy to the grid and do allocation via billing software (the community solar route).
	•	Subscriber Management and Billing: Shared solar means you have to handle potentially hundreds of subscribers per project. Ensuring accurate measurement of the solar output, translating that to bill credits, and collecting payments from subscribers (for whatever portion of savings you charge them) is non-trivial. While companies like Arcadia or Perch provide software solutions, a mid-sized firm entering this space either needs to partner with such or invest in a billing system. Any error in managing subscriptions can lead to customer dissatisfaction or revenue leakage. Utilities in CO and NM are moving towards consolidated billing (utility does the math of credits and charges), which helps. In Texas, absent VNM, one would have to set up independent billing (unless partnering with a REP who handles it).

2. Legal & Regulatory Barriers:
	•	Prohibition of Retail Wheeling (TX): As discussed, Texas doesn’t allow you to send power from one site to multiple off-site customers without going through a certified Retail Electric Provider. This legal barrier means any shared solar project in ERCOT must involve a REP or be confined to on-site use. This raises the complexity and likely requires regulatory navigations or partnerships (which could cut into margins or dissuade small projects).
	•	Utility and Regulatory Approval: In NM and CO, even with supportive policy, each project often needs various approvals – land use permits from local governments, interconnection agreements, and for NM’s initial batch, PRC approval of winners. If a project misses deadlines or fails to meet subscriber content (e.g., not signing up enough low-income customers), it could lose its slot. There’s a constant regulatory compliance overhead (reporting subscribers, demonstrating you meet the <40% per subscriber rule, etc.). In Texas, any new model might draw scrutiny from the PUCT if it appears to circumvent regulations.
	•	Contracting with Property Owners: Leasing a roof for 20–25 years is a legal endeavor that property owners may find intimidating. They often will have their attorneys scrutinize the lease for liability (e.g., who is responsible if a worker is hurt on the roof, or if the panels get blown off in a storm and cause damage?), maintenance responsibilities (does the solar company fix roof leaks? Do they remove panels if the owner needs to replace HVAC equipment?), access rights (when and how can the developer access the roof?), and end-of-life removal. These negotiations can be lengthy. If the building has a mortgage, the bank might need to consent to the solar lease (as it’s an encumbrance). If the building is sold, the lease must be assignable. These are all solvable (standard contracts exist in the industry), but they add transaction cost and can scare off some building owners who don’t want any hassle.
	•	Split Incentives in Leased Buildings: Many commercial buildings are leased to tenants (triple-net leases, etc.). The owner might get roof rent from solar, but if the tenants pay the electric bills, the owner might not care about solar beyond the rent check. Conversely, if a developer wants to lower tenants’ bills via solar, the owner might ask “what’s in it for me?” Solving this often means offering both: a small roof lease payment to owner and a benefit to tenants (or convincing the owner that solar makes the property more attractive to tenants). Navigating landlord-tenant dynamics is a barrier beyond pure policy.
	•	Market Competition and Saturation: In Colorado, the cap on community solar was limited; many developers compete for the allocated MW. Xcel’s RFPs often saw bids offering lower and lower REC prices (i.e., developers giving up REC value to win). This could squeeze margins. A new entrant might find it hard to win capacity against seasoned players unless they can undercut on price or offer some unique angle (like a great roof site no one else has, or superior low-income outreach to score higher in bids). In NM’s first RFP, over 400 proposals competed for 45 slots  – about a 1-in-9 chance of success per bid. The winners often had to offer generous community benefits or partnerships to score high. This means entry can be costly (lots of upfront work with a chance of no reward if not selected). It’s somewhat a barrier – not regulatory per se, but a product of the policy structure.

3. Financial & Economic Barriers:
	•	High Upfront Capital & Financing Complexity: Developing, owning, and operating a portfolio of roof-leased solar projects requires substantial capital investment. A mid-sized installer used to cash-and-carry installation jobs might not have experience raising project finance or dealing with tax equity investors. Now they would need to either: find tax equity (to monetize that 30-50% ITC), possibly find a construction loan and a long-term debt facility, and manage a performance over 20 years. Transaction costs for financing can be high on small projects – this is why aggregation or working with a partner fund is often needed. If the installer only does EPC for someone else, they avoid this, but then they’re not reaping the long-term revenue. In short, access to finance is a barrier. However, with the IRA incentives, many infrastructure funds are eager to invest in community solar, so a mid-sized developer might partner with such an investor (selling a project or getting financing).
	•	Credit Risk and Subscriber Management: Community solar projects rely on subscribers paying their bills. If a bunch of subscribers default or leave, that portion of the energy might go unsubscribed (which often results in a lower utility purchase rate for that energy, like avoided cost). Thus, there’s a revenue risk. To mitigate it, projects often require a reserve fund or set credit requirements for subscribers (though CO and NM now prohibit FICO checks for residential subscribers to keep it inclusive ). So developers must be prepared to handle churn – marketing to new subscribers constantly to maintain full subscription. That’s a different skillset (almost akin to running a small utility) and it adds cost. Many projects factor in a 5-10% “administrative cost” for this, which can be significant.
	•	Economies of Scale: Rooftop projects can have higher costs per watt than large ground-mounted ones (due to working on a roof, smaller size, potentially more expensive racking/ballast, etc.). If the market forces developers to offer, say, a 10% bill savings to subscribers and meet low-income quotas, the margin might be thin unless costs are kept low or incentives fill the gap. Smaller firms might have higher costs of capital too. Competing with bigger players who have economies of scale (bulk equipment procurement, standardized processes) is challenging. This can be a financial barrier to entry.
	•	Project Attrition and Delays: Because of the barriers above, attrition can happen – some projects might never reach operation (e.g., interconnection upgrades too expensive causing a developer to back out). In NM, as of late 2024, none of the selected 45 projects were online yet and some faced multi-year delays  . This delay can be a killer for smaller companies that need cash flow. If it takes 2-3 years to get revenue from a project after investing in development, that’s hard to sustain. Larger firms can absorb delays; smaller ones may fold or sell projects mid-way. So the timeline and friction in execution is a barrier.
	•	Regulatory Uncertainty: Policies can change. For instance, if a new PUC in NM decided to drastically cut the bill credit rate, projects could suffer. Or if Texas in 2027 passed a law penalizing distributed generators or limiting third-party solar, that could kill emerging models. Policy risk is a barrier that particularly affects someone considering entry into Texas now – they must weigh the chance that future rules might either favor them (like net metering mandate, which is unlikely in TX’s current politics) or hurt them (like fees on solar or requiring TDUs to charge DG owners). In Colorado, one regulatory uncertainty is how the utility will handle grid upgrade costs – there are ongoing discussions on whether to socialize some community solar interconnection costs given the public benefits, but no solution yet. Until resolved, each project bears that risk.

4. Barriers Specific to Roof-Leasing (versus ground-mount):
	•	Higher O&M Complexity: When panels are on someone’s roof, coordinating maintenance or repairs can be tricky. The developer needs access rights and to ensure minimal disruption to the business underneath. If a roof leaks or needs replacement mid-project, who pays to remove and reinstall the solar? Typically contracts specify that, but it could stop generation for a period (lost revenue). This makes investors slightly more wary of rooftop projects than fenced-off ground projects that they fully control. So one might face a bit higher perceived risk premium.
	•	Limited Roof Area per Site: One roof might only hold maybe 200 kW, or if it’s a big warehouse, maybe 2–3 MW. To get to, say, 20 MW portfolio, you might need 10+ different roofs. That’s 10 separate leases, 10 interconnections, 10 project SPVs – more paperwork and transaction costs relative to one 20 MW solar farm on a single plot. Unless you secure a few very large roofs (some are big: e.g., Denver’s old airport “Montbello” warehouse site had 8 MW of rooftop solar potential), you’re piecing together smaller bits. Portfolio approach can mitigate this, but it’s still an organizational challenge.
	•	Competition for Roof Space: Property owners may have other options or concerns. Some might want to reserve roof for future HVAC units or for their own solar one day. Or telecom companies might pay to put cellular antennas on roofs (though not usually in conflict with solar, it’s a consideration). So convincing owners to sign a long lease exclusively for solar can be a slow sell.

Despite these barriers, none are insurmountable. Many have been overcome in other states (e.g., NJ, NY, MA have lots of rooftop solar projects with leases). The keys are proper risk allocation in contracts, leveraging incentives to cover extra costs, working closely with utilities to manage interconnection issues (perhaps even co-funding upgrades that then allow multiple projects), and using software/partners to handle subscriber management efficiently.

Feasibility and Strategic Entry for a Mid-Sized Installer

Given the above analysis, how feasible is it for a mid-sized solar installer (with strong vendor relationships and an installation team) to enter the roof-leasing/shared solar space in TX, NM, and CO? In short: it is feasible with the right strategy and partnerships, especially in New Mexico and Colorado where policies favor such models. However, it will require scaling beyond a pure installer role into project development and energy service provision. Below are strategic considerations and recommended go-to-market approaches:

1. Target the Right Market and Niche:
	•	New Mexico – Immediate Opportunity: NM’s community solar program is a prime target for entry. As of 2025, many projects are in pipeline but more will come with the expanded cap (another ~300 MW). A mid-sized installer could enter in a few ways: partner with existing awardees to help build projects (leveraging your install team to secure EPC contracts), or develop your own project proposals for the next rounds (possibly in partnership with community organizations to score higher). Because NM requires 30%+ low-income subscribers, consider focusing on projects that benefit rural co-ops, tribal lands, or affordable housing providers – areas where you might have local connections and can craft a compelling proposal. With your vendor relationships, you might get cost advantages on equipment, allowing you to bid competitively. Feasibility in NM is high if you align with the program’s objectives (e.g., be ready to offer ~20-30% discounts to LMI subscribers, which you can afford if you get the IRA bonus credits). Also, NM being a relatively small community (energy-wise), your local presence or relationships (if any) can be a differentiator against big out-of-state firms. Actionable step: Identify potential roof hosts in NM (e.g., large warehouses in Albuquerque, farm co-ops in rural areas) and line up preliminary lease agreements – having a site in hand strengthens your bid. Also line up a subscriber partner (maybe a nonprofit that can help enroll low-income subscribers). This positioning can make you a strong contender or a desirable partner for larger developers to team with.
	•	Colorado – Competitively viable with differentiation: Colorado’s market is more crowded, but the new policy opens doors. The upcoming ~100+ MW in 2026-27 will be procured likely via competitive solicitations or standard offers. As a mid-sized entrant, consider teaming with an established player. For example, you could approach a developer like Nexamp, Pivot, or even a SunShare, and propose: you have access to certain prime roof sites in Colorado (perhaps through a relationship with a regional real estate firm), and you can handle on-the-ground construction, so why not co-develop? They might bring financing and subscriber management, you bring cost-effective EPC and local site acquisition, and you share the project equity. This could be a win-win, giving you entry and learning experience. Alternatively, focus on smaller utilities or niche projects: Xcel’s territory is saturated, but Black Hills Energy (around Pueblo, CO) has smaller programs and fewer competitors historically. Or, some municipalities (like Colorado Springs Utilities, which now is exploring community solar, or Fort Collins) might run their own RFPs for community solar projects – fewer national players may chase those. Use your agility to target those niches. Behind-the-meter multi-tenant solar is another possible niche: Colorado’s SB21-261 (the CU Boulder case) indicates large customers can virtually net meter – maybe you find another large institution (say a hospital network or a university) and offer to build a solar array on one of their properties to offset multiple facilities’ usage. That’s a quasi-community solar just for one entity. As Colorado is generally renewable-friendly, innovative proposals can find support (just ensure compliance with any PUC rules or get explicit permission if needed).
	•	Texas – Cautious and Partnership-Driven: Texas is the toughest nut to crack, but not impossible on a small scale. For a mid-sized installer, the immediate path is through municipal and cooperative utilities:
	•	Austin Energy’s program: It’s launching now (Dec 2024); you should engage immediately. Austin Energy likely will issue a request or have an application process for solar developers/property owners to participate in the Solar Standard Offer. Get the program details (contract PPA rate, term, requirements)  and start scouting commercial roofs in Austin. Use your vendor relationships to present an attractive proposition: for example, if Austin pays X cents/kWh for solar fed to them, can you build a system that makes money at that rate? If yes, approach building owners (maybe through the Austin Chamber of Commerce or direct contacts) and pitch the roof lease idea with the known backing of Austin Energy. Essentially, Austin Energy as the off-taker solves the hardest part of the equation in Texas. You just need to execute on finding sites and building efficiently. Given your install team, you could self-perform the EPC which cuts costs. This is a very feasible entry – municipal programs often welcome new developers to meet capacity goals. If you manage to sign up a few MW of projects in Austin, that becomes a case study to expand to other areas.
	•	CPS Energy or Other Munis: CPS had the pilot; they may expand it. Keep an eye on CPS Energy’s announcements – they had a strategic goal for more rooftop capacity. Perhaps propose to CPS a revival or expansion, using the success of the pilot to justify a phase 2 (maybe targeted at commercial roofs this time, not just residential). Also, other municipal utilities in Texas (like Denton Municipal, Austin suburbs like Georgetown, etc.) have renewable goals; you could pitch a similar program to them, effectively becoming the SolarHost provider in their area.
	•	Co-ops: Rural electric co-ops in TX (e.g. Pedernales EC, Oncor Electric Coop, etc.) might be interested in community solar if approached right. Some have done utility-owned community solar farms; maybe they’d let a third party do it if it saves them effort. You could offer a turnkey solution: “We’ll build, own, and operate a solar array on your system, and you simply buy the output or allow your members to subscribe.” Because co-ops are member-driven, they might like the idea especially if it involves local schools or community buildings as hosts. The barrier is co-ops often have full requirements contracts (e.g., with Brazos Electric or similar) that discourage buying from others – but some co-ops have carve-outs.
	•	Commercial PPA model in deregulated cities: Identify large property owners (maybe a real estate developer who owns multiple shopping centers or an industrial park) who are environmentally minded or want lower costs. Offer to put solar on their roofs and sell them the power via a long-term PPA at a rate slightly below their retail rate. Because it’s one customer (the building owner or master meter), this is legally fine. This essentially is a third-party PPA model. While not “shared” among multiple customers, if it’s a multi-tenant building and owner pays the aggregate bill, indirectly it’s shared. Given Texas’s low electricity rates and lack of net metering, you’d likely need to include storage or ensure a high self-consumption to make it worthwhile. But commercial rates (demand charge heavy) sometimes mean solar alone saves less; adding a battery to shave peaks plus provide backup could be a value-add to interest a customer. As a mid-sized installer, if you already install solar+storage for clients, this is just a different financing approach (you own the system instead of the client, and they pay for energy).
	•	REP partnership: Explore if any Retail Electric Providers want to differentiate by offering community solar. For example, Green Mountain Energy or MP2 or newer players might be interested in a pilot where their customers can opt into a community solar plan. You could be the backend developer building a few solar projects that feed into the REP’s portfolio, and the REP handles billing credits to subscribers. This is complex to negotiate, but if achieved, it overcomes the VNM barrier. It’s a longer shot, but worth networking at Texas renewable energy conferences to gauge interest.

2. Build Partnerships & Leverage Strengths:
As a mid-sized installer, your strengths likely include: on-the-ground installation expertise, local market knowledge, and vendor/distributor relationships that can get you good equipment pricing. Use these:
	•	Partner with developers/investors: Many investors have money but lack a trustworthy construction partner or local presence. You can fill that gap. In NM, for instance, some of the selected developers (say a company like SunVest from Wisconsin) may be seeking local installation subcontractors. You could subcontract and learn the ropes of community solar project management, while getting your foot in the door for future co-development. If you have capital or can raise some, you might negotiate partial ownership in exchange for discounted EPC price.
	•	Community/Nonprofit partnerships: Especially in NM and CO, forming partnerships with nonprofits, municipalities, or tribal entities can both strengthen your project’s scoring (in RFPs) and open up funding. For example, partner with a local housing authority to put solar on their properties and share benefits with residents. There are often grants or favorable lease terms for projects that benefit affordable housing. Similarly, tribes in NM might prefer working with a local installer who respects their priorities – perhaps you could do a community solar serving Navajo Nation off-grid homes or something (the Solar for All mentions off-grid tribal solar as a component ).
	•	Vendor financing or support: If you have good vendor ties, see if they or their financing arms can support you. Some panel manufacturers (e.g., QCells, through its financing affiliates) are interested in seeding community solar projects because it guarantees module sales. They might offer vendor financing or special pricing for projects that meet certain bankability criteria. Similarly, equipment like solar inverters or racking companies sometimes sponsor demonstration projects – you could leverage that to lower cost.
	•	Leverage being local in TX: In Texas, out-of-state companies might not know the quirks of ERCOT or how to navigate the local utility contacts. If you are Texas-based, you have an edge in understanding, say, the interconnection processes with CenterPoint or how to negotiate with a Texas landlord. Emphasize that in any partnership or pitch.

3. Financial Strategy:
	•	Start Small to Build Track Record: Perhaps don’t aim to own 50 MW on day one. Begin with a few pilot projects – even a single 500 kW on a strip mall in New Mexico under the program, or a 1 MW on a school in Colorado for a community solar garden. Prove that you can handle development, subscription, and O&M. This track record will make it easier to get financing for scaling up. Many community solar developers started with one or two projects and then ramped up once investors saw performance.
	•	Use Third-Party Services: There’s no shame in outsourcing subscriber management or O&M monitoring initially. For example, sign up with a platform like Perch Energy to handle your NM subscriber sign-ups and billing – they charge a fee per customer but ensure compliance and happy subscribers. This lets you focus on what you do best (install and relationship management).
	•	Explore Public-Private financing: Some states have green banks or clean energy funds (Colorado was considering one). NM’s Green Energy Market Securitization (GEMs) program – if implemented – could provide low-interest loans for community-based solar projects. Keep an eye on such opportunities to reduce your cost of capital.
	•	Insurance and Risk Mitigation: Work with insurers to get good coverage for your projects (e.g., coverage for hail on panels – important in CO/TX, insurance for subscriber default risk perhaps). A well-insured project is more bankable. There are even specialty products now that insure performance of community solar subscriber payments.
	•	Profitability Outlook: If done right, these projects can yield solid returns. For instance, a community solar project might generate an unlevered IRR of ~8-10% (leveraged ~12-15%) given the incentives, which is attractive. As a mid-sized player, you can accept slightly lower returns if you retain long-term ownership and also earn margin on construction. Over time, recurring revenue from energy sales and subscriptions could provide a steady cash flow for your business, smoothing out the typical feast-or-famine of install work.

4. Competitor/Case Profiles to Emulate or Learn From:
Studying peers can provide guidance:
	•	PowerFin (TX SolarHost) – They succeeded by aligning with a utility. Their pilot teaches that utilities may be open to innovative proposals if you present it as low-risk for them. Also, they targeted underserved areas to help the utility meet equity goals, which was wise.
	•	Namasté Solar (CO) – A mid-sized employee-owned installer in Colorado that historically did rooftop installs, but then co-developed some community solar gardens (like the Jacque Solar Garden in CO, an agrivoltaic project). They balanced being an EPC and taking on development risk in partnership with others. They remain successful by focusing on community-oriented projects and leveraging their local reputation.
	•	Solar Landscape (NJ) – While much larger, their approach to working with big property portfolio owners (like Extra Space Storage, Prologis) is something to consider. Perhaps in Texas you could approach a self-storage company or a grocery chain about leasing roofs across multiple properties, bundling them into one big virtual project (though TX doesn’t have virtual credit, you could do a deal where that company’s stores get the energy via a VPPA or just do it as a straight lease+wholesale sale with RECs for their ESG goals).
	•	Cooperative/community-led projects: There are examples like the Kit Carson Electric Coop solar arrays in NM or Energy Outreach Colorado’s low-income community solar projects, where community organizations spearheaded the project and hired contractors. Being the contractor of choice for such initiatives can be a gentler entry and builds goodwill and brand recognition.

5. Go-to-Market Recommendations:
	•	For Texas: Focus on Austin Energy Solar Standard Offer as a near-term entry point. Develop a sales pipeline of commercial property owners in Austin (perhaps using the city’s announcement to market: “Did you know you can earn money by leasing your roof for solar? We’ll handle everything, and Austin Energy will buy the power to help the community”). Essentially, piggyback on the city’s promotion. Simultaneously, engage with CPS Energy to see if they plan to expand SolarHost (if yes, position yourself to bid or partner). For broader ERCOT, maybe pick one pilot “private” project to do: e.g., find a medium manufacturing company interested in resiliency and sustainability, propose a solar+storage system that you own on their roof with a PPA that includes backup power. This showcases a model of selling to a single off-taker – simpler than multi-tenant – but you own it (starting your asset portfolio in TX).
	•	For New Mexico: Try to become a Subscriber Organization (that’s what NM calls community solar developers) in the next RFP. If you feel bidding alone is too risky, join a team. Perhaps partner with a local community bank or credit union to add credibility (they often like to support such projects). Highlight local job creation in your bid – as an installer, you bring that directly. Also, differentiate by offering a slightly higher low-income subscription percentage or discount than the minimum; that could boost your bid score and you can afford it due to IRA credits. On execution, since none of the initial 45 projects are built yet, even being slightly later, you won’t be far behind – there’s still a learning curve for everyone. If possible, find a project in NM that can use an existing building or land owned by a supportive entity (like a county government that wants solar for residents); these partnerships can lighten the development load (permitting, local acceptance).
	•	For Colorado: Engage in the 2025 Xcel RFP or 2026 at the latest. Meanwhile, perhaps start with one small municipal project: e.g., approach a city like Boulder or Fort Collins that have climate action plans. They might allow a third-party to develop a community solar on a city facility. Win that relatively easier (less competition) project, which might be say 1 MW on a water treatment plant roof or something, and use it as a case study. Then leverage that experience to go into Xcel’s larger market. Also, consider agrivoltaic community solar – Colorado law favors that now. If you have any rural connection, maybe do a 10 MW solar garden on a farm that continues to graze sheep under it, and subscribe local town residents. That could be a unique selling point in bids.

Feasibility verdict: For a mid-sized installer with initiative and smart partnerships, entering the shared solar market in NM and CO is quite feasible and could be highly rewarding. Texas is tougher but not impossible, focusing on local enclaves of support (Austin, etc.). The key is to adapt your business model: you’ll be transitioning from just an installer to a developer/operator role. This means new skills (financial modeling, legal structuring, customer service). It might be wise to hire or consult with a couple of industry veterans (maybe someone who worked at a community solar firm) to avoid pitfalls.

Key Legislative and Regulatory Developments (2025–2026)

Looking ahead, several anticipated or potential changes in 2025–2026 could expand or restrict the opportunities in each state:
	•	Texas: As mentioned, the 2025 Texas Legislature ended with major anti-renewable bills defeated , but the risk looms that in 2027 similar bills could resurface . If those were to pass, they could impose extra costs on solar projects (like requiring pairing with gas or paying for reliability services). That would negatively impact project economics in Texas. On the positive side, one small hope is that continued grid reliability concerns might lead Texas to recognize the value of distributed generation – there’s been talk of incentivizing backup generators or rooftop solar+storage to help in grid emergencies (post-URI 2021 blackout). The PUCT’s “roadmap” includes integrating DERs and perhaps creating markets for them . By 2025/26, ERCOT might implement a pilot for aggregated DERs to provide peak capacity. If so, a portfolio of rooftop solar (especially if with storage) could earn extra revenue through those programs. Also, by 2026 Austin Energy’s program results will be evident – if successful, it could inspire other Texas cities (like El Paso Electric or co-ops) to start similar standard offer or community solar programs. Keep an eye on the Texas Solar Energy Society and SEIA’s local chapter – they advocate for pro-solar policies (e.g., removing barriers for third-party PPAs in munis, or pushing for clearer community solar enabling laws). But realistically, no big supportive state law is expected in 2025–2026 from the current legislature.
	•	New Mexico: The big changes here are happening via the PRC and potentially a supportive legislature:
	•	The PRC’s expansion to 500 MW cap indicates momentum . In 2025 or 2026, the PRC might authorize even more capacity if the initial projects roll out well. Also, once the initial pilot phase is evaluated (likely by 2026), the legislature could make the community solar program permanent and possibly uncapped (or with a trajectory). It’s plausible that NM could move to an annual procurement model like CO did, ensuring continual growth rather than one-off allocations.
	•	Grid upgrades and cost allocation: There’s likely to be policy action to address the high grid upgrade costs. The legislative report suggests the PRC portion of the Solar for All grant ($18M) will be used to offset some interconnection costs  . Additionally, a rule or legislation might allow utilities to socialize some upgrades that have broad system benefit (especially if they lead to improved reliability or capacity beyond the solar project). If upgrade costs can be reduced, more rooftop projects (which often have to connect in urban centers where grid might be constrained) become viable. Watch for PRC dockets on interconnection reform.
	•	Community Solar for co-ops/munis: The 2025 session might see a bill to encourage or fund community solar in rural areas not covered by SB84. For example, a program to allow co-ops to opt in and get a share of that Solar for All money to do projects. If something like that passes, it expands the addressable market to the rest of NM (which is significant territory).
	•	Net Metering and Solar Rights: NM already has decent solar rights (HOAs can’t ban solar, etc.). One improvement that could come is if NM considers virtual net metering for multifamily buildings. Right now, an apartment building could perhaps install a solar system and use the community solar framework to credit tenants (if they sign up as subscribers), but maybe a simplified path could be made specifically for onsite multi-tenant shared solar (to avoid the whole RFP and competitive process if it’s just one building’s tenants). If NM regulators see a gap (landlords not doing it because it’s complicated), they might address it.
	•	Colorado: Implementation of SB24-207 will be the main event. The PUC in 2025 will likely engage stakeholders to update community solar rules per the statute:
	•	They’ll define the process for those 53.5 MW annual procurements for 2026-27 (could be a competitive RFP, a standard offer with set price, or something like a tariff program). Depending on the mechanism, it could either favor big players (competitive RFP might drive prices low) or open doors to many (standard offer might let all qualifying projects in until MW cap hits).
	•	The PUC will also integrate the new consumer protection elements. Utilities might request cost recovery for changes (like billing system upgrades for consolidated billing).
	•	There’s also SB23-214 (if I recall correctly) about energy storage and distribution planning, which might interplay by encouraging storage with community solar. By 2025/26, we may see community solar+storage projects in Colorado, especially with IRA credits for storage (if co-located, storage can also get ITC now).
	•	Legislatively, Colorado’s political climate is favorable to more clean energy. If anything, they might further increase requirements or incentives for community solar if they want to push distributed generation as part of grid resilience. One possible tweak: raising the 53.5 MW/year if demand is high, or extending mandates beyond 2027.
	•	Another aspect: Performance-based regulation. Xcel is moving towards performance incentives, possibly some metric around customer renewable access which community solar contributes to. This could make the utility more cooperative in expanding shared solar.
	•	Net metering changes: Unlikely to regress; Colorado will keep net metering. If anything, they might eventually consider NEM 3.0 style reforms if high solar penetration, but that’s more a post-2030 thing given CO’s moderate rooftop adoption now.

In all states, a factor to watch is the evolution of federal policy: if by 2025 a new administration or new Congress changes the IRA provisions or if interest rates remain high (increasing financing costs) – these external factors affect the market viability. But presently, the policy winds for distributed solar are positive at federal level.

Recommendations and Actionable Insights

Finally, synthesizing all the above, here are actionable recommendations for a mid-sized installer (and strategic insights):
	•	Focus on Policy-Enabled Markets First: Direct your business development efforts to New Mexico and Colorado where the rules and incentives are aligned with shared solar. Texas, while huge in opportunity, should be a secondary, opportunistic play until there’s more clarity or you have successes under your belt elsewhere. Essentially, don’t fight the tide: go where policies want you to succeed (NM, CO) and use those successes to perhaps influence or capitalize on any niche in TX.
	•	Develop Turnkey Solutions for Property Owners: Create a clear value proposition package for commercial property owners: “We monetize your idle roof, you earn $$ per square foot with zero investment, and you contribute to community sustainability.” Include FAQs addressing their concerns (roof warranties, access, etc.). Perhaps partner with roofing companies to offer a bundle: if a roof needs replacement, coordinate to include solar installation post-roofing – a one-stop solution might attract owners who otherwise postpone solar due to roof condition. By making it easy and low-risk for property owners, you remove a major barrier. In markets like Austin, highlight that they’ll be part of a city program powering low-income homes (good PR for them). In NM/CO, emphasize any tax or marketing benefits (LEED points, CSR storytelling about hosting community solar).
	•	Cultivate Relationships with Utilities and Regulators: In community solar, being on good terms with the utility can smooth interconnection and coordination. Participate in PUC workshops or stakeholder meetings in NM and CO to stay on top of rule changes and to make your voice heard (perhaps advocating for things that help smaller players, like simplified application processes or carve-outs for projects under 1 MW or those on rooftops). If regulators see active engagement from local businesses, they may take that into account (e.g., designing programs not just for big out-of-state developers but also local participants). Also leverage industry associations (Colorado Solar & Storage Association, Renewable Energy Industries Association of NM, etc.) – they often have committees on community solar.
	•	Differentiate through Community Engagement: Because community solar inherently involves the “community,” use your local presence as a selling point. Sponsor local events, engage with city councils, run informational workshops for residents about community solar. This can generate leads for subscribers and goodwill that might help in obtaining site leases (a church might be more willing to lease their roof to you if they know you as a community partner, for example). Case in point: In the NM selection, some scoring favored community benefits and local partnerships – replicate that sincerely by involving local workforce (train and hire from the community for installations) and offering a portion of subscriptions to community institutions (e.g., give a free 5 kW subscription to the local library or senior center). These touches not only improve bid scores but build a brand reputation that can be powerful as you expand.
	•	Manage Barriers Proactively:
	•	Do interconnection studies early (even informal assessments with utility engineers) to avoid nasty surprises. Possibly target “low-hanging” grid locations – e.g., in NM, maybe near substations with spare capacity, or in CO, feeders with light existing PV. Use tools if available (some utilities publish hosting capacity maps).
	•	Address legal barriers by creative structuring: If TX doesn’t allow multi-tenant sale, structure it as selling to the landlord (master meter) or become a REP (a bigger step – maybe not feasible for mid-size, but one could acquire a small REP license as a vehicle in ERCOT). Or piggyback on existing aggregation models (like how some companies create a cooperative to sign up members and act as a single virtual customer).
	•	Set aside budget for subscriber acquisition – don’t underestimate that cost. But try to minimize it by partnering with subscriber organizations (Solstice, etc.) who might already have lists of interested customers in the area.
	•	Ensure you educate subscribers well – avoid the pitfalls seen in some markets where customers got confused by two bills or savings not meeting expectations. Happy subscribers mean stable revenues and less attrition (which lowers your admin costs).
	•	Scale Carefully with Quality Control: As you ramp up projects, maintain installation quality – one bad incident (like a roof leak claim or a safety accident) could tarnish trust with property owners or cause program scrutiny. Use your installation expertise as a competitive edge: highlight your safety record, NABCEP certifications, etc., to give comfort to stakeholders that you will professionally execute projects on their properties.
	•	Monitor and Adapt to Policy Changes: Keep a close watch on 2025-2026 regulatory outcomes – for example, if NM lowers the bill credit value after first projects, you might shift focus to ensure your cost structure still works. If Colorado’s new rules allow 10 MW on rooftops and if you identify a candidate roof, be ready to jump – maybe a large distribution center could host such a project; a single 10 MW on a roof would be one of the largest in the world and a marquee project (imagine the publicity and lead-gen from that!). Conversely, if some unfavorable rule comes (like say Colorado imposed a surcharge on community solar to fund low-income programs, hypothetically), adjust your financial models quickly to still deliver value.
	•	Consider Storage Integration: Looking forward, pairing batteries with rooftop solar might enhance the model: you could provide peak shaving services to the building or grid services to the utility (earning extra revenue). For instance, Austin Energy might down the line pay for dispatchable solar+storage. If you’re comfortable with storage installs, this could differentiate your offerings, especially in Texas where on-site reliability is a big issue after the 2021 outages. “Solar plus backup power at no upfront cost” could attract certain customers.
	•	Exit Strategy or Long-Term Hold: Decide if you want to be a long-term owner/operator of these solar assets or develop and flip. Many mid-sized developers choose to sell projects (or portfolios) to bigger investors once operational to recycle capital. This can be lucrative – community solar farms have sold for attractive multiples given the stable contracted cash flows. If your goal is steady cash flow, you might keep ownership, but that means you become an asset manager for 20 years. There’s no right or wrong, but plan accordingly. If selling, build projects to a high standard and document everything (good data room, etc.) to get the best price. If holding, ensure you have or can build the capacity to manage O&M (or contract a reputable O&M provider) and customer service for subscribers over the long haul.

In conclusion, the roof-leasing and shared solar model in TX, NM, and CO presents a transformative business opportunity – turning underutilized roof real estate into community-serving power plants. The novelty of the model ranges from embryonic (Texas) to established (Colorado), but trends are clearly toward more distributed, community-inclusive solar deployment. With supportive policy frameworks in New Mexico and Colorado, and emerging utility-led models in Texas, a mid-sized installer can transition into this space and thrive, provided they adapt to the new complexities of energy sales and multi-party engagement. By leveraging their installation prowess, forging smart partnerships, and aligning with policy incentives, they can not only enter this space but shape it – helping drive a new era where commercial rooftops become a significant source of our clean energy supply.

The upward trend in electricity prices, particularly in Colorado, supports the financial case for solar leasing, as higher grid prices make solar energy more competitive.
Current (2025) Energy Prices
Current electricity prices were derived from the EIA’s Electric Power Monthly for March 2025, the latest available data as of June 5, 2025. These prices reflect retail rates by sector and state, with utility-specific rates noted:
	•	Texas: Average retail price in March 2025 was 9.39 cents/kWh, with utility-specific rates like Austin Energy varying by plan.
	•	Colorado: Average retail price in March 2025 was 11.91 cents/kWh, with Xcel Energy offering rates around 10.96 cents/kWh for commercial customers.
	•	New Mexico: Average retail price in March 2025 was 9.04 cents/kWh, with PNM Resources providing rates around 10.17 cents/kWh for commercial customers.
PPA rate benchmarks for commercial-scale solar projects are typically 5–7 cents/kWh, making solar leasing competitive, especially with rising grid prices.
Future Projections (2025–2030)
Future electricity price projections were sourced from various reports, with state-specific data where available:
	•	Texas:
	•	ERCOT forecasts a 50% increase in electricity demand by 2029, driven by data centers and industrial growth, potentially increasing prices.
	•	Wholesale prices for 2025 are trading at a premium, but 2026–2027 contracts are lower, suggesting long-term stability.
	•	Rising natural gas prices (projected 24% increase in 2025) may offset wholesale declines, keeping retail prices stable or rising.
	•	Colorado:
	•	The Common Sense Institute projects electricity rates to increase from 14.7 cents/kWh in 2025 to 18.4 cents/kWh by 2030, a 56% rise, driven by emission reduction policies.
	•	Factors like natural gas prices, peak demand, and grid stress are expected to contribute to this trend.
	•	New Mexico:
	•	Specific state projections are limited, but the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2025 suggests a national decrease from 12.2 cents/kWh in 2022 to 11 cents/kWh by 2050.
	•	Local factors like renewable adoption and demand growth may lead to higher prices, though exact figures are unavailable.
Table 2: Electricity Price Projections (Cents/kWh)
Year	Texas (Estimated)	Colorado	New Mexico (Estimated)
2025	9.5	14.7	9.1
2030	10.0	18.4	9.5
The projected price increases, especially in Colorado, enhance the financial viability of solar leasing, as higher grid prices make solar energy more attractive.

Rooftop Solar Leasing Market Viability (TX, CO, NM, 2015–2030)

1. Historical Electricity Prices (2015–2024)

Retail Rates by Sector: Over the past decade, electricity rates in Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico have risen across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. For example, in 2015 Texas’s average residential price was about 11.6¢/kWh, while Colorado’s was ~12.0¢ and New Mexico’s ~12.6¢  . Commercial rates were lower – on the order of 8–10¢/kWh in 2015 – and industrial rates lower still (often 5–7¢/kWh range) due to higher-voltage service and load factors. By 2023, retail prices had climbed significantly. Texas residential customers paid around 14.3–14.9¢/kWh on average  , while Colorado residential rates reached about 14.3¢ and New Mexico ~13.8¢ . Commercial tariffs in 2023 were roughly 8.8¢ in Texas, 11.6¢ in Colorado, and 10.7¢ in New Mexico . Industrial rates – traditionally the lowest – rose from mid-single-digits to roughly 6.6¢ in Texas and 8.5¢ in Colorado by 2023 (New Mexico’s industrial power remained very inexpensive, ~5.8¢ in 2023) . In summary, all three states saw ~15–20% retail price growth over 2015–2024, with residential rates increasing the most in absolute terms (Texas +3¢, Colorado +2¢, NM +1–2¢). Texas’s retail prices have generally remained below the U.S. average, while Colorado’s are near the national average and New Mexico’s slightly lower  .

Wholesale Price Trends:  Wholesale electricity prices in regional markets serving these states have been volatile. In the mid-2010s, average wholesale spot prices were relatively low – often on the order of $20–40 per MWh (2–4¢/kWh) for ERCOT (Texas’s grid) and for the Southwest (SPP and Western hubs)  . For instance, ERCOT’s average real-time energy price hovered in the ~$30–$45/MWh range in 2015–2019 under mild conditions. However, fuel cost spikes and extreme events drove up prices in the 2020s. Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 caused an unprecedented price spike (monthly average >$1,800/MWh), lifting ERCOT’s 2021 annual average price well above normal  . 2022 saw high natural gas prices, and ERCOT’s average wholesale price for the year was on the order of $70/MWh (lower than 2021’s anomaly but much higher than pre-2020)  . In 2023, with gas prices easing, ERCOT’s prices moderated somewhat – the average “all-in” wholesale price was about $65–79/MWh (still among the highest in the nation)  . By contrast, the SPP market (which serves parts of NM/CO) has benefited from abundant wind generation and saw lower 2023 prices – averaging only about $31–32/MWh   after spiking to ~$60+ in 2022. Overall, wholesale power costs roughly doubled from the mid-2010s to early 2020s, contributing to rising retail rates, though 2023 brought some relief in most regions. (Notably, all three states lack capacity markets, so energy price volatility directly influences generators’ revenue and, eventually, retail fuel cost adjustments.)

2. Current (2025) Electricity Prices

Latest Retail Rates: As of early 2025, electricity prices remain elevated. Texas’s average residential rate is ~15.6¢/kWh – roughly 5–8% below the U.S. residential average, which hovers ~16.5¢ . Colorado’s residential rates are comparable (around 15¢) , and New Mexico’s slightly lower (~14¢). Commercial customers in Texas pay around 8.7¢/kWh on average in 2025 (significantly below the U.S. commercial avg.) , whereas commercial rates in CO and NM tend to be in the 10–12¢ range. Industrial rates remain the lowest: e.g. Texas industrial tariffs ~6–7¢, NM’s as low as ~5–6¢ (thanks in part to cheap local generation) . It’s worth noting that utility-specific tariffs can vary. For instance, Austin Energy (a municipal utility in Texas) uses a multi-tier residential rate:  base energy charges range from 4.1¢/kWh (Tier 1) to 10.9¢/kWh (Tier 4) as usage increases  , plus a fuel cost adjustment (~5.3¢ minus a credit of 1.2¢) and fixed charges – yielding an effective rate of ~8¢ for low usage and up to ~15¢ at high usage. Xcel Energy (Public Service Co. of Colorado) has now transitioned all Colorado residential customers to time-of-use (TOU) rates. Under the default TOU plan, summer electricity prices range roughly from 10¢/kWh off-peak to 17–18¢ on-peak, with winter rates lower (e.g. ~8–9¢ off-peak)  . New Mexico’s main investor-owned utility, PNM, offers standard volumetric rates that equate to about 13–14¢/kWh for residential customers (with full-retail net metering for solar, see below). These current rates underscore the relatively high cost of grid power – a key driver of the rooftop solar economics.

PPA Rate Benchmarks (2025): Power purchase agreement (PPA) prices for new solar energy are favorable and underscore the opportunity for third-party solar resale. Utility-scale solar PPA offers in early 2025 average around $45–60 per MWh (4.5–6¢/kWh) in the Southwest. In fact, ERCOT (Texas) has some of the lowest solar PPA prices in the nation – recent utility-scale solar PPAs are averaging about $44/MWh . The broader SPP/Western region is slightly higher (solar PPAs ~$58/MWh in CAISO, and ~$57–65 in SPP/MISO) . These figures are wholesale energy prices for large projects, but they indicate that third-party developers can produce solar power well below retail rate levels. For commercial-scale behind-the-meter solar serving a building, PPA rates are typically higher than utility-scale (to account for smaller project size and customer-specific costs), yet still often in the 8–12¢/kWh range for onsite solar deals – which can be a few cents below retail grid tariffs. In sum, 2025 retail rates in TX/CO/NM remain in the mid-teens (cents) for residences and ~$0.08–0.12 for businesses, while solar PPA rates in the region are on the order of $0.05–0.06 (utility-scale) to ~$0.08–0.10/kWh (commercial PPA). This spread underpins the financial case for installing PV and selling the output under long-term agreements.

3. Future Price Projections (2025–2030)

Price Trend Outlook: Looking ahead, most forecasts anticipate moderate electricity price growth through 2030, rather than huge spikes – but with important nuances. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in its Short-Term Energy Outlook, expects retail power prices to “continue rising” in the near term . For example, EIA projected U.S. residential electricity would average about 15.3¢/kWh in 2023, up from 14.8¢ in 2022 . This upward drift (~3–5% annual increases) was attributed largely to high wholesale fuel costs (natural gas) being passed through . However, with natural gas prices having since fallen from 2022 highs, 2024–2025 may see only modest rate increases in many areas. In fact, EIA’s 2024 outlook shows more tempered growth: total U.S. electricity expenditures are forecast to rise gradually as demand grows, but expanding renewable generation is expected to soften wholesale price increases  .

For Texas, several factors could exert upward pressure on prices: robust demand growth (driven by population, industrial load, and new sectors like crypto mining and EVs) and tight reserve margins in ERCOT suggest peaks will remain expensive. ERCOT’s regulators have been exploring market reforms to incentivize new capacity, which, if implemented, might add costs to retailers and thus slightly higher rates. On the other hand, Texas is adding large amounts of wind, solar, and battery storage which increase supply and mitigate fuel cost volatility – this is expected to cap energy price growth somewhat. The consensus projection is that Texas retail rates will rise slowly (perhaps on the order of +0.5¢ per year) in real terms, assuming natural gas stays in the ~$3–4/MMBtu range. Extreme weather remains a wild card: continued occurrences of record summer heat or winter freezes could spur price spikes and drive year-to-year volatility in both wholesale and retail rates .

In Colorado and New Mexico, price trajectories will depend on generation resource shifts and fuel trends. Both states have aggressive renewable energy targets by 2030 (e.g. Colorado aims for 80% carbon-free power by 2030), which entail retiring some coal plants and investing in renewables and transmission. In the mid-term, utility resource plans show capital investments that will put some upward pressure on base rates (to pay for new wind/solar, transmission, etc.), but also reductions in fuel and carbon costs that offset some of that increase. Projections from Xcel Energy (CO) and PNM (NM) filed with regulators indicate relatively flat energy costs (thanks to cheap renewables) but higher fixed costs – netting to small rate increases. EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook suggests that Mountain region retail prices (which include CO/NM) will rise slightly above inflation through 2030, then level off as renewables achieve high penetration. In practical terms, this could mean Colorado’s average retail rate inching from ~11.8¢ in 2023 to perhaps ~13–14¢ by 2030 (in 2023 dollars). New Mexico might see a similar or smaller increase (since its 2023 rates are lower, ~9.5¢ all-sector, rising to maybe ~11¢ by 2030).

Key Drivers:  The main factors influencing price trends are: Natural gas prices – gas-fired generation sets the market price at the margin in all three states (especially in ERCOT), so gas forecasts (which currently show moderate prices ~$4–5/MMBtu later this decade) directly shape wholesale electricity prices . Renewable build-out – rapid growth of zero-fuel-cost solar and wind (Texas alone plans tens of GW of solar additions in the next few years ) will tend to suppress energy market prices, particularly in midday and high-wind periods, potentially flattening the upward price curve. Peak demand and capacity – if peak loads grow faster than new dispatchable capacity, scarcity pricing can raise average costs (ERCOT’s high 2023 prices were partly due to a “heat dome” causing record peak demand ). Utilities and regulators may respond with new pricing structures (e.g. time-of-use rates, demand charges) that shift or reduce peak usage, affecting average customer bills. Policy and carbon costs – while TX has no state carbon price, federal regulations (e.g. on power plant emissions) or regional market rules could indirectly impact costs. Colorado and NM, for instance, are transitioning away from coal; in the short run, there may be some costs to recover stranded assets, but by late-2020s the expectation is a more stable or declining fuel cost portion of rates due to renewables. In summary, moderate increases in nominal electricity prices are expected through 2030 in all three states – on the order of a few percent per year – rather than the sharp jumps seen in 2022. This baseline of rising grid prices underpins the value proposition of distributed solar, though the rate of increase is not extreme. Any shocks (fuel price spikes, extreme weather, etc.) could temporarily accelerate price hikes, whereas technological or policy breakthroughs (e.g. cheaper storage, demand response) could temper the trend.

4. Solar Incentives & Policies

Net Metering and Solar Compensation: Each state has distinct policies for compensating rooftop solar generation:
	•	Texas: There is no statewide net metering mandate for competitive retail areas. In practice, solar buy-back terms are set by individual retail electric providers (REPs) or utilities. Several REPs offer “net metering” style plans (crediting excess kWh at retail rate up to what you consume, and often at lower avoided-cost rates beyond that). Municipal and co-op utilities in Texas often have their own programs. Notably, Austin Energy uses a Value of Solar (VoS) tariff – solar customers sell all generation to the utility at a fixed credit rate (around 9.5¢ per kWh in recent years) and buy all their usage at the standard rates . This effectively nets out, but the credit rate is recalculated annually based on solar’s value to the grid. San Antonio’s CPS Energy similarly credits solar exports at a tariffed rate (slightly above avoided fuel cost). Elsewhere in Texas, REPs like TXU, Green Mountain, etc., may offer full-retail net metering for systems up to a certain size (often with conditions, e.g. you must be a net consumer over a 12-month period). Key takeaway: While one-to-one net metering isn’t guaranteed by law in Texas, market competition has led to many solar-friendly plans, though terms vary. Rooftop projects that intend to sell exclusively to the grid (not just reduce the host’s bill) typically must operate as Qualifying Facilities selling at avoided-cost or partner with a REP via a PPA.
	•	Colorado: Colorado has strong net metering policies for investor-owned utilities. Xcel Energy (the state’s largest utility) must offer net metering for systems up to 120% of the customer’s annual consumption. Excess generation is credited at the full retail rate and carried over month to month. At year-end true-up, any surplus is generally credited at the utility’s avoided cost rate or can be rolled forward (or donated to a low-income energy fund, at the customer’s choice). Colorado’s net metering has been in place since 2005 and was extended in 2018 to explicitly allow batteries, etc. Additionally, Colorado pioneered community solar gardens – shared solar arrays up to 5 MW where subscribers (including those who can’t put solar on their own roof) get bill credits. The credits for community solar subscribers are set at the retail rate (for Xcel, this is via a rider called RenewableConnect or SolarRewards Community). In 2023, Colorado passed an inclusive solar law to expand community solar access (the PUC is implementing a new program to replace the existing solar-gardens program with a more inclusive model) . This is relevant because it encourages third-party developers to build solar on large roofs or land and sell output to subscribers (including tenants, etc.) with credits on their utility bills. Third-party ownership of solar is explicitly allowed in Colorado – the law treats onsite solar developers (e.g. lease/PPA providers) as not regulated utilities, so companies like Sunrun, Tesla Energy, and others freely offer leases/PPAs to homeowners and businesses . There are also state incentives like sales and property tax exemptions for solar equipment, and some grants for schools and public buildings.
	•	New Mexico: New Mexico requires its investor-owned utilities to offer net metering for distributed generators up to 80 MW (!) – effectively covering all rooftop and medium solar systems . Excess energy is credited at retail rate; however, utilities typically true up monthly, issuing either a credit or payment at avoided cost for any net excess each month . (In other words, you can run the meter backwards within the billing period at full retail, but you won’t accrue a huge surplus credit year-to-year – excess is cashed out at a lower rate periodically.) New Mexico has recently launched a Community Solar program as well: a 2021 law enabled development of community solar projects (up to 5 MW each, with 30% of capacity reserved for low-income subscribers). The program is in pilot phase – developers were selected in 2022/2023 to build projects and subscribers (including renters, etc.) will get bill credits for their share of generation. This opens another avenue for third parties to lease rooftops and sell solar output via the community solar framework. Like Colorado, third-party PPAs/leases are legal in NM – the Public Regulation Commission has ruled that such third-party solar providers are not “public utilities” when they install on a customer’s property and sell that customer power . This legal clarity means companies can offer solar leases to, say, a church or business in NM without fear of violating utility statutes. New Mexico also offers a generous Solar Market Development Tax Credit (a state tax credit for solar installations, recently renewed through 2032) which can indirectly support third-party projects (through pricing or by partnering with tax equity).

Incentives & Programs: All three states benefit from the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) – currently 30% for solar – which third-party owners can monetize (and in the case of tax-exempt site hosts, pass some benefit via lower PPA rates). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act expanded this with potential bonus credits (for domestic content, projects in energy communities, etc.) and a direct-pay option for tax-exempt entities (which could indirectly spur more solar on nonprofits and municipal facilities). State-level incentives include: New Mexico’s aforementioned 10% solar tax credit (capped at $6k per system) ; Colorado’s various utility rebate programs (mostly phased out for residential, but some remain for income-qualified or for batteries); and Texas’s patchwork of local incentives (e.g. CPS Energy in San Antonio gives rebates per kW, Oncor utility had incentives for commercial solar, etc.). Net metering retention is a crucial “incentive” itself – for instance, Colorado has thus far resisted utility attempts to add fixed fees or reduce net metering credit value (unlike California’s recent NEM 3.0 cuts). However, policy watchers note that many states are revisiting DG compensation. The NC Clean Energy Center’s 50 States of Solar report found numerous states considering net metering reforms in 2025, including demand-charge proposals and export rate changes  . In our region: El Paso Electric in West Texas recently proposed replacing its minimum bill for solar customers with a demand charge (a move that solar advocates oppose as it could erode solar savings) . Changes like this, if adopted, may affect project economics – we will need to monitor PUC decisions closely. On the flip side, New Mexico’s regulators in 2023 actually expanded a program to allow aggregate net metering for certain customers (e.g. state agencies can credit solar output to multiple meters). Overall, policy momentum is generally supportive of distributed solar in CO and NM, with active efforts to broaden access (community solar, low-income carve-outs), whereas Texas relies on market-driven approaches and could see more utility pushback in certain pockets (co-ops or munis imposing fees).

Third-Party Ownership & Leasing: Importantly, all three states permit third-party rooftop leasing models. Colorado and New Mexico explicitly protect the right to third-party solar PPAs (their PUCs ruled that a third-party owning panels on your roof and selling you electricity is legal and exempt from utility regulation as long as they only serve that on-site customer) . Texas, being mostly deregulated, allows all sorts of retail arrangements – in competitive areas a customer could even buy power from a solar developer who registers as a REP. Even in municipal/co-op territories, third-party leases are common (the third party leases the equipment to the customer, rather than selling kWh, to avoid running afoul of exclusive service rights). In short, our rooftop leasing + energy resale model is legally viable in TX, CO, and NM. We can own/operate PV on someone else’s roof and either sell the power to the building occupant (via a PPA or lease arrangement) or to the utility/grid under net metering or a PPA. Each state has specific interconnection rules we’ll comply with, but there are established processes for <1 MW systems in all three. One emerging incentive to note: the IRA’s Direct Pay option for tax-exempt entities means, for example, a church or school could effectively get the 30% ITC refunded – this might lead some such customers to prefer ownership. But many will still lack upfront capital or appetite, so third-party owned (with us capturing ITC and depreciation) remains attractive.

5. Market Viability Insights (Competitive Landscape, Revenue, Barriers)

Existing Players & Precedents: The rooftop solar leasing model is already being pursued by various companies in these states, indicating a proof of concept. In the residential segment, national third-party solar firms like Sunrun, Sunnova, Tesla Energy etc., have been active (Sunrun and Sunnova in particular offer solar leases/PPAs in Texas and Colorado). Our focus, however, is the commercial and institutional rooftop market – and here we see growing interest from both specialized developers and large energy firms:
	•	In Texas, commercial solar adoption has lagged behind some states (due to cheap wholesale energy and lack of state incentives), but it’s picking up. Companies such as Freedom Solar, Sunfinite, Big Sun Solar and others have installed solar on warehouses, churches, and schools often via third-party financing. There isn’t a dominant “rooftop leasing” pure-player yet in TX, but some community solar-style projects have emerged in co-op territories. Notably, several retail electric providers (like MP2 Energy and others) have partnered with building owners to put solar on-site and supply the output to the grid or tenants. For example, in San Antonio, Big Sun Solar developed rooftop projects that sell power to the local utility via a feed-in tariff.  (Goodwill Industries in San Antonio recently did 4 store rooftops with Big Sun Solar under such an arrangement). The early adopters in Texas tend to be either (a) large corporates with sustainability goals (installing solar on their owned facilities) or (b) third-party developers targeting multi-tenant real estate – but the latter often require creative solutions since, in competitive areas, you either need all tenants to agree to buy output or set up a master meter. We see an opportunity to differentiate by handling that complexity (perhaps becoming an aggregator or REP for the building).
	•	In Colorado, the commercial third-party solar market is relatively mature. Black Hills Energy (utility) has a program for third-party developers to build solar on customer sites and sell to the utility (through “Solar Rewards” incentives). More directly, companies like Catalyze (a Colorado-based C&I solar firm) and Pivot Energy have been aggregating commercial rooftops for solar development. Catalyze, for instance, acquired large real estate portfolios (like cold storage warehouses) and is installing PV plus batteries, effectively leasing roof space and then selling energy via both on-site PPAs and community solar subscriptions. Community solar developers are very active in Colorado, many of whom use leased rooftops: recent PUC filings show multiple 2–5 MW “solar gardens” sited on warehouse roofs or parking canopies along the Front Range, developed by firms like Namasté Solar, Oak Leaf Energy, and others. These companies typically pay the roof owner either a rental fee or provide discounted electricity. Colorado’s policy environment (retail rate credit, bill credit programs) has spurred a mini-industry of third-party solar project developers – we would be entering a market where some competitors have a head start. However, there is no single dominant player owning the rooftop leasing space; it’s fragmented. Our advantage could be in aggregating smaller commercial sites that others overlook, and leveraging relationships with property owners (self-storage companies, church dioceses, etc.).
	•	In New Mexico, the market is emerging. Historically, NM had fewer third-party solar financers; many commercial projects were customer-owned with help of USDA grants or state incentives. But with the new community solar program, a number of outside developers (some from Colorado/Texas) are entering NM to build projects. For example, Odin Energy and Pivot Energy have won bids to develop community solar arrays in NM – some of which may be on commercial roofs. There’s also Affordable Solar (a local Albuquerque-based EPC) that sometimes partners on third-party projects. We may also consider public sector partnerships in NM: e.g. the City of Albuquerque leases roof space on its convention center for a solar array that a third party owns and operates, selling the city the power (this was done under a PPA). All told, NM is a bit behind CO in deployment, but that means opportunity: fewer incumbent third-party operators and many large flat roofs (warehouses around Albuquerque, big-box stores, etc.) ripe for solar.

Revenue Potential (Leased Roof Economics): Property owners typically expect a rent payment or equivalent benefit for hosting our solar installations. Based on industry reports and current deals, payments for rooftop leases range from $0.10 up to $1.00 per square foot per year for prime commercial roof space . Higher payments (approaching $1/sqft) are more achievable in markets with high electricity prices or lucrative incentives, whereas in lower-price areas the rent might be only a few cents per sqft. To illustrate: a 100,000 sqft warehouse roof (about ~1 MW of solar potential) could fetch on the order of $50k–$100k per year in lease revenue to the owner under a generous arrangement . More commonly, developers might offer the host either a modest annual lease payment or a slight discount on power if the host is also the off-taker. In our model, where we plan to resell energy either to tenants or the grid, we should be prepared to share some of that value. Typical revenue per kW of commercial PV can be ~$100–150/MWh * times* ~1,400 MWh per MW-year (capacity factor ~16%) = ~$140k–210k per MW-year gross. After expenses, splitting some portion with the roof owner (perhaps $20k–$50k/MW-year) can make sense while keeping the project profitable. That aligns with the ~$0.20–$0.50/sqft range for many deals. Indeed, Catalyst Power notes that simply “capitalizing on an existing asset” with no effort can yield meaningful passive income for building owners, making the pitch attractive .

Beyond lease payments, another way to entice property partners is energy cost savings. For example, a landlord might prefer an arrangement where we sell power to their tenants at a slight discount to utility rates (making the property more attractive) in lieu of direct rent. Our flexibility in structuring these benefits – either as cash rent, reduced common area electricity cost, solar marketing (green branding), or a combination – will be key to signing up hosts.

Barriers and Challenges: While the fundamentals are strong, there are some barriers and risks to acknowledge:
	•	Interconnection Limits & Grid Constraints: Each project must secure interconnection to the local distribution grid. In parts of Colorado and New Mexico, distribution feeders are reaching high solar penetration, which can trigger upgrades or caps. Utilities sometimes impose limits on aggregate net-metered capacity (e.g. 10% of feeder peak) – potentially slowing approvals. We could face wait times or upgrade fees, especially for multi-megawatt projects in weaker rural grids. Mitigation: target sites in areas with available grid capacity (this requires up-front study and working closely with utilities). Texas, under ERCOT, generally has a straightforward interconnection for distributed generation and no explicit cap, but in areas with demand charges (like co-ops) the effective value of exporting solar can drop. Also, ERCOT’s energy-only market means no guaranteed capacity payment – selling excess generation from a rooftop at times of low prices (e.g. mild spring days) yields very little revenue. This merchant volatility is a risk in Texas if we rely on selling back to grid; hedging via a PPA with a REP or large customer can offset that.
	•	Regulatory/Policy Risks: As discussed, net metering policies could change. If, say, Colorado moved to a “buy-all, sell-all” avoided cost rate for solar exports (similar to California’s new system), the economics for third-party sale would worsen. Texas could see more utilities adopting fixed charges or demand charges on solar customers (reducing the savings we can offer). New Mexico’s community solar program has a 200 MW cap in the pilot phase – if not expanded, that limits how many projects we can develop to sell to subscribers. Additionally, evolving building codes (like requiring solar on new buildings, or roof warranty issues) could influence our approach. We must stay agile and perhaps prioritize markets with more stable incentives or lock in long-term contracts where possible (e.g. 20-year subscriber agreements or utility feed-in tariffs) to secure revenue streams.
	•	Local Opposition or Permitting: Commercial rooftop solar generally faces less local opposition than ground-mount farms (it’s out of sight, makes use of existing structures). However, there can be hurdles: historic buildings or certain cities might have aesthetic concerns (glare, etc.), or fire codes requiring set-asides on the roof. Most of these are minor issues, but worth noting. For example, in some jurisdictions, adding solar triggers a requirement to upgrade the roof’s structural load capacity or install certain safety features, which can add cost. Building owners will want assurance that our installations won’t void their roof warranty or cause leaks – meaning we need high-quality workmanship and possibly to include roof maintenance or a re-roof as part of the deal (some solar leases include an allowance to re-cover the roof before installation).
	•	Utility Pushback: Utilities sometimes actively push back on third-party projects, especially if they feel revenue erosion. As noted, El Paso Electric’s move to demand charges is one example . In New Mexico, El Paso Electric (which serves part of southern NM) for years disallowed third-party PPAs in its territory until clarified by the PRC. We should expect negotiations on interconnection and metering terms – e.g. utility may require us to install a second meter for the solar output, charge standby fees in some cases, or limit how we can allocate power to tenants. It’s important to engage regulators and perhaps participate in proceedings to defend favorable policies (an opportunity for us to help shape policy as a stakeholder, given our business model’s reliance on fair export compensation).
	•	Opportunity – Favorable Trends: On the positive side, market and policy trends are creating new opportunities for this model. The Inflation Reduction Act incentives (30% ITC + potential 10% adders) significantly improve project ROI – and critically, tax-exempt entities can now effectively benefit via direct pay, meaning we could even structure deals where, for instance, a church or school owns a small share of the array to get the direct pay, while we own the rest. Also, energy price volatility itself has made large energy users more open to onsite solar. The sustained high electricity rates are causing commercial customers to seek alternatives – our pitch of a fixed 20-year PPA at, say, 10¢ (with zero upfront) is very appealing against current 12¢+ tariffs with uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate ESG goals are driving companies to utilize their real estate for clean energy. Many REITs and big-box retailers have sustainability mandates to put solar on stores/warehouses; some will do it themselves, but others prefer a third-party to handle it. We can target those portfolios (for example, Prologis – a major warehouse REIT – has a program to lease roof space for solar across the country).

In terms of leading companies or early adopters: firms like Catalyze, Pivot Energy, Sunrun (Brightbox business division), and NextEra Distributed Generation are all active in various forms. Catalyze (backed by utilities like APS and investment firms) has been acquiring rights to commercial roofs for solar+storage in Colorado, focusing on multi-tenant industrial parks. NextEra has a distributed generation group that, for instance, partnered with a self-storage company to deploy solar on dozens of storage facility roofs in the Southwest. Utility-owned efforts are also emerging: Public Service of Colorado (Xcel) proposed a program to let them rent customers’ rooftops for utility-owned solar, though it hasn’t been approved – a sign that even utilities see the value. These competitors indicate a nascent but growing market. None have blanket coverage of Texas/Colorado/New Mexico, so there is room for a focused business unit like ours to establish a strong regional presence.

In conclusion, the financial case for a Rooftop Solar Leasing & Energy Resale venture is promising. Electricity prices are on the rise (in real terms, likely up ~10–20% by 2025–2030)  , enhancing the savings we can offer. PPA rates and solar costs are favorable, allowing us to generate power at well below retail rates. Policy frameworks, especially in Colorado and New Mexico, support third-party involvement through net metering, community solar, and legal clarity for PPAs  . And while we must navigate challenges like interconnection and rate design changes, we can leverage lessons from current market players and perhaps even partner with them or fill gaps they miss (e.g. smaller roofs or certain customer segments). By providing building owners a no-hassle revenue stream (potentially up to $1 per sqft/year for their roof ) and delivering cheaper clean power to tenants or the grid, we tap into a win-win formula. Our business plan should incorporate conservative assumptions on rate escalation (to ensure projects remain economic even if prices flatten) and flexibility to adjust to policy shifts. Overall, the outlook for launching this rooftop solar leasing + resale model in 2025–2026 across Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico is strong – aligning with both market needs (hedging against rising energy costs) and policy goals (decarbonizing the grid via distributed resources) without significant friction from existing regulations.
