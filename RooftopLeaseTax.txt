Rooftop Lease Tax Info



Key Points
	•	Research suggests owning and leasing rooftop solar installations can offer significant tax benefits, including a 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and depreciation advantages.
	•	It seems likely that state-specific property and sales tax exemptions in Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico can reduce costs, though details vary by state.
	•	The evidence leans toward owning being financially advantageous due to tax credits and depreciation, but third-party financing might reduce upfront costs and risk.

Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)
The federal ITC allows your company to claim a 30% tax credit on the cost of solar installations in 2025, reducing your federal tax liability. You can also opt for a direct-pay option if tax liability is low, and there may be additional adders for specific projects. Since you own the systems, you retain this benefit, unlike in leasing arrangements where tenants can’t claim it.
Depreciation Benefits
You can depreciate solar systems over 5 years using MACRS, with a 40% bonus depreciation in 2025, meaning you can deduct 40% of the cost in the first year after adjusting for the ITC. This accelerates returns, but remember, the depreciable basis is reduced by half the ITC amount.
State Tax Implications
	•	Texas: Offers a 100% property tax exemption on increased property value due to solar, but no sales tax exemption, so you’ll pay sales tax on equipment.
	•	Colorado: Has both property and sales tax exemptions, lowering equipment costs and property taxes.
	•	New Mexico: Also offers both exemptions, similar to Colorado, reducing upfront and ongoing costs.
Leasing Arrangements
Owning the systems lets you claim all tax benefits, but leasing income is taxable. You can deduct operational expenses like maintenance. Property owners may still claim property tax exemptions, which doesn’t directly benefit you but supports the leasing model.
Owning vs. Third-Party Financing
Owning captures tax benefits like ITC and depreciation, requiring more upfront capital but offering higher long-term returns. Third-party financing, like PPAs, reduces initial costs and risk but forfeits these benefits, potentially lowering revenue.

Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Tax Implications for Owning and Leasing Rooftop Solar Installations
This analysis explores the tax implications, incentives, and financial advantages associated with your company directly owning rooftop solar installations and leasing them to property owners or tenants in Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, as of June 5, 2025. The focus is on federal and state tax credits, depreciation benefits, property and sales tax exemptions, leasing arrangements, and a comparative analysis of owning versus third-party financing structures.
Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)
The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), also known as the Residential Clean Energy Credit, is a significant incentive for solar installations. As of 2025, the ITC allows businesses to claim a 30% tax credit on the cost of installing solar energy systems, applicable to new photovoltaic (PV) systems and expansions (Federal Solar Tax Credit: How it works in 2025 | SolarReviews). This credit directly reduces federal tax liability, with no cap on the amount claimable and no income limits, making it accessible for your company as the system owner.
	•	Direct-Pay Option: Under the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses can elect to receive the ITC as a direct cash payment from the IRS if they have limited tax liability in a given year, enhancing cash flow (What Is the 2025 Federal Solar Tax Credit? - SmartAsset).
	•	Adders: Additional ITC adders may be available for projects in low-income communities or using domestic content, though these are specific and may not apply universally (Solar Tax Credit: 2025 Guide - Nexamp).
	•	Eligibility for Leasing: Since your company owns the solar systems and leases them, you retain the ITC, as only the system owner can claim it. Property owners or tenants under lease agreements cannot claim the ITC (Federal Tax Credit for Residential Solar Energy - TurboTax).
Note: There have been legislative proposals to accelerate the phase-out of the ITC post-2025, but as of June 2025, the 30% rate remains in place for systems installed by year-end (Trump and the Fate of the 30% Solar Tax Credit in 2025 | Solar.com).
Depreciation Benefits
Depreciation is another key financial advantage for owning solar installations, allowing your company to recover the cost over time through tax deductions.
	•	MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System):
	•	Solar installations are classified as 5-year property under MACRS, enabling depreciation over 5 years with higher deductions in early years (MACRS Depreciation | StraightUp Solar).
	•	This accelerated depreciation schedule improves cash flow by reducing taxable income in the initial years.
	•	Bonus Depreciation:
	•	For 2025, businesses can claim 40% bonus depreciation on qualified property, including solar installations, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act phasing schedule (Bonus Depreciation: What You Need To Know | EnergySage).
	•	This means 40% of the depreciable basis can be deducted in the first year, with the remaining 60% depreciated over the 5-year MACRS schedule.
	•	Adjustment for ITC:
	•	If your company claims the 30% ITC, the depreciable basis must be reduced by half the ITC amount (15% of the total cost), as per IRS rules (What Is Bonus Depreciation For Commercial Solar Projects (2025) | 8MSolar).
	•	Example: For a $100,000 solar system:
	•	ITC: $30,000 (30% of $100,000)
	•	Depreciable basis: $100,000 - ($30,000 / 2) = $85,000
	•	Bonus depreciation: 40% of $85,000 = $34,000 (deducted in year 1)
	•	Remaining basis: $51,000, depreciated over 5 years using MACRS.
This combination of MACRS and bonus depreciation significantly lowers your tax liability in the early years, accelerating the return on investment (MACRS Depreciation for Commercial Solar Savings, Tax Benefits - Green Ridge Solar).
Property Tax Implications
Property tax exemptions for solar installations vary by state, and since your company leases the systems to property owners, it’s important to understand how these exemptions apply.
	•	Texas:
	•	Texas offers a 100% property tax exemption on the increased appraised value of a property due to the installation of solar energy devices, as per Texas Property Tax Code section 11.27 (Texas Solar Property Tax Exemption | Square Deal Blog).
	•	This exemption is claimed by the property owner, not the solar system owner. Therefore, even if your company leases the solar system, the property owner can still claim the exemption, ensuring no additional property tax burden due to the solar installation.
	•	Colorado:
	•	Colorado provides a property tax exemption for solar energy systems installed on residential and commercial properties, excluding the added value from property tax assessments (Solar Property Tax Exemptions Explained | EnergySage).
	•	Like Texas, this exemption is typically claimed by the property owner, benefiting your leasing model by keeping property taxes stable for tenants.
	•	New Mexico:
	•	New Mexico offers a property tax exemption for the increased value of a property due to solar energy installations, as part of state incentives for renewables (Solar Tax Exemptions | SEIA).
	•	Again, this exemption is claimed by the property owner, supporting the financial viability of leasing arrangements.
Key Note: In all three states, the property tax exemption is tied to the property itself, not the ownership of the solar system. Thus, even in a leasing arrangement, the property owner can benefit, which indirectly supports your business model by making solar leasing more attractive to property owners.
Sales Tax Exemptions
Sales tax exemptions on solar equipment purchases can reduce upfront costs, and their availability varies by state:
	•	Texas:
	•	Texas does not offer a sales tax exemption for solar equipment. Your company would need to pay sales tax when purchasing solar panels and related equipment, increasing initial costs (Solar Tax Exemptions Exist, Find Out How to Save (2025)- EcoWatch).
	•	Colorado:
	•	Colorado provides a sales and use tax exemption for components used in solar energy systems, including panels, inverters, and installation materials (Solar Tax Exemptions – SEIA).
	•	This exemption applies to your company’s purchases, reducing the cost of acquiring equipment.
	•	New Mexico:
	•	New Mexico also offers a sales tax exemption for solar energy systems, covering equipment and installation costs, further lowering upfront expenses (Are Solar Panels Exempt From Property Taxes and Sales Taxes in Your State? - CNET).
Summary Table:
State	Property Tax Exemption	Sales Tax Exemption
Texas	Yes (100% on increased value)	No
Colorado	Yes	Yes
New Mexico	Yes	Yes
This table highlights the cost-saving opportunities, particularly in Colorado and New Mexico, where both exemptions are available.
Leasing Arrangements and Tax Obligations
When your company owns the solar installations and leases them to property owners or tenants, several tax implications arise:
	•	Tax Benefits for the Company:
	•	As the owner, your company retains the federal ITC (30% in 2025) and depreciation benefits (MACRS + 40% bonus depreciation), as discussed earlier.
	•	These benefits are not transferable to the property owner or tenant, ensuring your company captures the full tax advantage.
	•	Leasing Income:
	•	Income from leasing the solar system to property owners or tenants is taxable as ordinary income under federal and state tax laws.
	•	However, your company can deduct operational expenses related to the solar system, such as maintenance, insurance, and repairs, as business expenses, offsetting taxable income (Solar Land Leasing: Lease Rates & Taxes | YSG Solar | YSG).
	•	Property Tax Exemptions:
	•	As noted, property tax exemptions are typically claimed by the property owner, not the solar system owner. This means the property owner can still benefit from state exemptions, which doesn’t directly affect your company’s tax obligations but supports the leasing model’s attractiveness by keeping property taxes stable for tenants.
	•	State-Specific Considerations:
	•	In Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, there are no specific state-level tax implications for leasing solar systems beyond standard income tax treatment. However, ensure compliance with state-specific lease agreements and local regulations, such as those related to property use and zoning (Solar Farm Land Leases in Texas | Silberman Law Firm, PLLC).
This structure allows your company to leverage tax benefits while generating revenue through leasing, though careful tax planning is essential to optimize deductions and manage taxable income.
Comparative Analysis: Owning vs. Third-Party Financing
To understand the trade-offs, let’s compare your proposed model (owning and leasing) with third-party financing structures, such as Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or solar leases where a third party owns the system:
	•	Owning and Leasing (Your Proposed Model):
	•	Advantages:
	•	Your company retains the federal ITC (30% in 2025) and depreciation benefits (MACRS + 40% bonus depreciation), potentially saving significant tax liability (MACRS: Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System | EnergySage).
	•	Potential for higher long-term returns through leasing income and tax benefits, especially with rising electricity prices.
	•	Greater control over system maintenance, operations, and long-term value.
	•	Disadvantages:
	•	Requires significant upfront capital for purchasing and installing solar systems, which may strain cash flow.
	•	Your company bears the risk of system performance, maintenance, and potential obsolescence, especially in states like Texas with no sales tax exemption.
	•	Property owners may still claim property tax exemptions, but your company does not directly benefit from these, though it supports the leasing model.
	•	Third-Party Financing (e.g., PPA or Solar Lease):
	•	Advantages:
	•	Lower upfront costs for your company, as a third party finances and owns the system, reducing initial capital outlay.
	•	Reduced operational risk, as the third party handles maintenance, system performance, and potential upgrades.
	•	Property owners or tenants can benefit from lower electricity costs without owning the system, potentially making it easier to attract tenants.
	•	Disadvantages:
	•	Your company forfeits the federal ITC and depreciation benefits, as these go to the third-party owner, reducing potential tax savings (Solar Tax Credits and Incentives 2025 | Enphase).
	•	Less control over the system and its long-term value, potentially limiting revenue opportunities.
	•	Potential for lower revenue, as your company would not directly benefit from tax incentives, relying instead on negotiated terms with the third party.
	•	Key Trade-Off:
	•	Owning and leasing allows your company to capture significant tax benefits but requires more capital and operational responsibility. This model is financially advantageous if your company has the cash flow and risk tolerance, especially given the 2025 incentives.
	•	Third-party financing reduces upfront costs and risk but sacrifices tax incentives, potentially lowering overall returns. This might be suitable if capital is limited or risk mitigation is a priority.
Given your focus on owning the systems, the evidence leans toward this model being more financially viable in 2025, particularly with the 30% ITC and 40% bonus depreciation. However, consider the upfront investment and operational burden, and consult a tax professional for optimization.
Summary of Financial Advantages
	•	Federal ITC: Claim 30% tax credit on installation costs, enhancing cash flow (Homeowner’s Guide to the Federal Tax Credit for Solar Photovoltaics | Department of Energy).
	•	Depreciation: Leverage 40% bonus depreciation in 2025, plus MACRS over 5 years, after adjusting for ITC, accelerating returns.
	•	Property Tax Exemptions: Available in all three states for property owners, reducing their tax burden and supporting leasing attractiveness.
	•	Sales Tax Exemptions: Available in Colorado and New Mexico, reducing equipment costs; not available in Texas, increasing initial outlay.
	•	Leasing Income: Taxable as ordinary income, with operational expenses deductible, balancing revenue and costs.
	•	Owning vs. Third-Party: Owning provides tax benefits but requires more capital; third-party financing reduces risk but forfeits incentives.
This comprehensive approach ensures your company can build a financially viable rooftop solar leasing model, leveraging federal and state incentives while managing tax obligations effectively.

### **1. Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Adders**
- **ITC Basics**: Your company can claim **30% of the solar system’s eligible costs** (panels, inverters, labor, etc.) as a tax credit under [26 USC § 48](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/48).  
  - **Lease Impact**: The ITC is available to the system’s *owner*, so your company (as owner-lessor) qualifies.  
  - **Direct Pay (Elective Pay)**: Since 2023, tax-exempt entities and certain businesses can elect **direct pay** (refundable cash payment) in lieu of the credit. Your company may qualify if it meets IRS requirements.  
- **Adders**:  
  - **Domestic Content Bonus (10%)**: Available if ≥40% of steel/iron and manufactured products are U.S.-sourced.  
  - **Energy Community Bonus (10%)**: For projects in brownfield sites, coal communities, or areas with high fossil fuel employment.  
  - **Low-Income Bonus (10–20%)**: For projects serving low-income households (requires meeting specific criteria).  

---

### **2. Depreciation Benefits**
- **MACRS Depreciation**: Solar assets are classified as **5-year property** under MACRS. Your company can depreciate **85% of the system’s cost** (after subtracting half the ITC) over 5 years.  
  - Example: A $1M system gets a $300k ITC → depreciable basis = $1M - ($300k × 50%) = $850k.  
- **Bonus Depreciation**: Under [TCJA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1), 60% bonus depreciation is available in 2024 (phasing down annually). This lets you deduct **60% of the basis upfront**, then depreciate the remaining 40% over 5 years.  

---

### **3. State-Specific Property Tax Implications**
- **Texas**: Solar installations are **exempt from property tax** under [Texas Tax Code § 11.27](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TX/htm/TX.11.htm).  
- **Colorado**: Solar is **exempt from property tax** for residential systems; commercial systems may qualify for a **reduced assessment rate** (e.g., 29% of actual value).  
- **New Mexico**: Solar is **fully exempt from property tax** under [NM Stat § 7-36-21.3](https://nmonesource.com/nmos/nmsa/en/item/4340/index.do).  

---

### **4. Sales Tax Exemptions**
- **Texas**: Solar equipment purchases are **sales tax-exempt** ([Texas Tax Code § 151.355](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TX/htm/TX.151.htm)).  
- **Colorado**: Solar equipment is **sales tax-exempt** ([CRS § 39-26-719](https://leg.colorado.gov/statutes/39-26-719)).  
- **New Mexico**: Solar equipment is **sales tax-exempt** ([NM Stat § 7-9-55](https://nmonesource.com/nmos/nmsa/en/item/3985/index.do)).  

---

### **5. Leasing Arrangement Tax Implications**
- **Lease Income Taxation**: Lease payments are **ordinary income** (taxed at your company’s rate).  
- **Operational Expense Deductions**:  
  - Maintenance, insurance, and monitoring costs are **deductible**.  
  - Interest on debt financing is deductible (subject to IRS limitations).  
- **ITC Recapture Risk**: If the system is sold or taken out of service within 5 years, the ITC may be partially recaptured.  

---

### **6. Owning vs. Third-Party Financing Comparison**
| **Factor**               | **Your Company Owns (Lease Model)** | **Third-Party (PPA/Lease)** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **ITC Eligibility**      | Yes (your company claims)           | No (third-party claims)     |
| **Depreciation**         | Full MACRS + bonus                  | Lost to third-party         |
| **Cash Flow**            | Lease income offsets costs          | No upfront cost, but lower margins |
| **Risk**                 | Higher (ownership liability)        | Lower (third-party assumes risk) |
| **Customer Appeal**      | Moderate (lease terms matter)       | High (no upfront cost)      |

---

### **Recommendations**
1. **Maximize ITC + Adders**: Target projects in energy communities or with domestic content.  
2. **Leverage Bonus Depreciation**: Accelerate cash flow by front-loading deductions.  
3. **Use State Incentives**: Exploit property/sales tax exemptions in TX, CO, and NM.  
4. **Structure Leases Carefully**: Ensure lease terms protect ITC eligibility (e.g., avoid "pass-through" leases that could disqualify the ITC).  

For tailored advice, consult a tax attorney or CPA familiar with renewable energy projects. The IRS’s [Energy Incentives for Businesses](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/businesses-energy-credits) page is also a helpful resource.

Owning rooftop solar systems and leasing them to commercial property owners or tenants can offer significant tax benefits. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the key federal and state-level tax incentives and considerations for such a business model in Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico.

⸻

Federal Tax Benefits

1. Investment Tax Credit (ITC)

The federal ITC allows businesses to deduct a percentage of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their federal taxes. As of 2025, the ITC provides a 30% credit for eligible solar projects. Additional “adders” can increase this credit: 
	•	Domestic Content Adder: An extra 10% credit for projects using U.S.-made components. 
	•	Energy Community Adder: An extra 10% credit for projects located in designated energy communities. 
	•	Low-Income Community Adder: An extra 10% credit for projects in low-income areas. 

These adders can potentially increase the ITC to 50% for qualifying projects.

2. Depreciation Benefits (MACRS and Bonus Depreciation)

Under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), businesses can depreciate solar energy equipment over a five-year period. Additionally, bonus depreciation allows for a larger deduction in the first year: 
	•	2025: 40% bonus depreciation. 
	•	2026: 20% bonus depreciation. 
	•	2027 and beyond: Bonus depreciation phases out. 

For example, a $1,000,000 solar project in 2025 would allow for a $300,000 ITC and $340,000 in bonus depreciation, with the remaining $510,000 depreciated over five years.  

⸻

State-Level Tax Incentives

Texas
	•	Property Tax Exemption: Texas offers a 100% property tax exemption on the appraised value added by a solar energy device used primarily for on-site energy production.  
	•	Sales Tax Exemption: While Texas provides sales tax exemptions for certain solar energy devices, the applicability can vary based on the equipment and its use.

Colorado
	•	Sales and Use Tax Exemption: Colorado exempts all sales, storage, and use of components used in solar energy systems from the state’s sales and use tax.  
	•	Property Tax Exemption: The added value of a solar installation is exempt from property tax assessments in Colorado.

New Mexico
	•	Solar Market Development Tax Credit: Provides a 10% credit (up to $6,000) for the purchase and installation costs of solar systems.  
	•	Property Tax Exemption: Installed residential solar energy systems are exempt from property tax assessments.  
	•	Sales Tax Exemption: New Mexico offers a gross receipts tax deduction for the sale and installation of solar energy systems, effectively serving as a sales tax exemption.  

⸻

Tax Implications of Leasing Solar Systems

When a company owns and leases solar systems:
	•	Lease Income: The rental income received is taxable and must be reported as ordinary income.
	•	Operational Expenses: Expenses related to the maintenance and operation of the leased systems can be deducted from taxable income.
	•	Depreciation and ITC: The owner (lessor) is entitled to claim both the ITC and depreciation benefits, as they retain ownership of the asset.

⸻

Considerations and Recommendations
	•	Stay Informed on Legislative Changes: Tax incentives can change based on federal and state legislation. It’s crucial to stay updated on any changes that may affect solar tax benefits.
	•	Consult Tax Professionals: Engage with tax advisors familiar with renewable energy projects to navigate the complexities of tax incentives and ensure compliance.
	•	Evaluate Financial Models: Consider the long-term financial implications of owning versus third-party financing structures to determine the most beneficial approach for your business.
