Energy. Empathy. Excellence 
# SunShare Initiative

SunShare is a visionary infrastructure model that transforms idle rooftop and land space into multi-purpose, revenue-generating, community-benefiting clean energy hubs.

We start with solar—then go further: WiFi, EV charging, atmospheric water, energy storage, and more.

We believe in distributed power. Not just electricity—but connection, equity, and resilience.

This repo serves as a timestamped declaration and living document of the SunShare model.
